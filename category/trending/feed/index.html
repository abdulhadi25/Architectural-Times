										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you becoming increasingly frustrated with the unpredictability of life these days? Are you sick of hearing about the coronavirus? Tired of being stuck at home with difficult people? Are the current world events bringing you down and affecting your mental health? Do you find yourself in a downward spiral with no end in sight? Are you having extremely conflicting feelings regarding the lockdown being lifted?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any of these, I want you to know you are not alone. Many of us are feeling overwhelmed with the current situation and it feels like there is no end in sight and while we can&#8217;t control the virus what we can control is our response to it. Many of us might be waiting for the situation to fix itself rather than finding ways to acclimate to our surroundings. If you’re feeling out of control then its time to switch your focus from things you cannot control to things you can control; and the only thing we have any control over is ourselves and how we choose to react and respond. Below are some tried and tested ways to address your feelings in a way that is helpful to you and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set some boundaries for yourself.</strong> One thing that can be extremely helpful is asking friends and families to stop sending coronavirus updates. Such messages can be triggering and can really affect our mental health because it consumes our thoughts and feelings. Another useful tip is to stop watching the news. Let go of your need to constantly know what’s happening, instead set a boundary for yourself in terms of how much information you receive. Make a commitment to yourself to get only one update per day and save yourself from the overload of negative information out there.</li>
<li><strong>Make small but helpful adjustments to your daily routine. </strong>Adding a morning mantra to your routine can be extremely helpful as it sets the tone for the day. A very popular mantra used for many years is:</li>
</ul>
<p>God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change</p>
<p>The courage to change things I can and the</p>
<p>Wisdom to know the difference</p>
<p>A daily “check-in” with yourself is also another way to understand your feelings better. Simply ask yourself the following questions: How do I feel at this moment? How is my body reacting to the environment? Where in my body am I carry my emotions? Do I have more negative thoughts or positive ones? Again knowing how you feel first thing in the morning will also help set the tone for the day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand unwanted thoughts and feelings. </strong>While checking in with yourself you may find you have a lot of unwanted thoughts or feelings. One of the easiest and quickest ways to counter these thoughts is to fact check them. Ask yourself how realistic these thoughts and feelings are? Are they in sync with your surroundings? Many times we find our mind has been playing tricks on us by making us believe what we are feeling is real, which of course it is. But the question to ask yourself is “is this feeling valid?” and more often then not you will find your thoughts and emotions are irrelevant to the situation. If they are not, go back to the above mantra and identify between what you can control and what you cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Create a support system. </strong>Asking for help from others can be very nerve-wracking, but knowing you are not alone in your fears and anxiety is an antidote itself. When we realize there are others who feel similar to us it gives a sense of belonging and understanding. Sometimes the support system you create for yourself consists of friends and family, other times it could be a support group or a therapist. Whatever is your comfort zone identify it and remember to access it in times of need.</li>
<li><strong>Breathe!</strong> <strong>It will be okay! </strong>I know this lockdown has really changed our lifestyle and many of us might have trouble adjusting to it and that’s totally okay! Take your time, experiment and find out what’s right for you, what works and what doesn’t and slowly but surely you will find stability in the midst of chaos.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Future of  Architecture &#8211; The concept of architecture is as deep-rooted as the existence of man on this planet. With the initiation of human settlement, the primary motive was to have a shelter. Starting with the notion of shelter-building for survival it has now turned into one of the most important amphitheaters of our lives. History has witnessed its evolution from a mere concept of arranging shelter to the most endorsed and esteemed forms of art. Needles to say, the evolution in the respected domain is persisting with the blink of an eye leaving the spectators wondering.</p>
<p>Every adept architect is essentially a great poet and the former of the epitomes of his time, his day, and his age. While representing their age, these epitomes yearn for heir timeless commemoration. However, the role of architecture in the progression of mankind is patent. Each epoch has its customs of planning, designing, building and, preserving its distinctiveness. Over time, this progression has also been imperiled to stagy modifications and paved the way to get a glimpse of the future. As the architect of today must have the capability to peep into the future. Here are the most growing trends that are efficient in providing a glimpse of the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/what-is-building-information-modeling-bim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future of architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Virtual Reality &amp; Immersive Architecture provides access to an artificial world that has set the world to take the architecture world by storm. Virtual reality &amp; immersive architecture helps clients to have a better understanding of their project by facilitating them to observe and make objects tangible for them. With the collaboration of processor visuals, wireless chasing tools, earpieces, HD projectors, polarized schooners, the immersive architecture empowers the feedback process dramatically and fetching perfection in the architecture industry.</p>
<h3>Natural Disaster Resistant Architecture</h3>

<p>The previous decade is reported as the most unfortunate decade due to the recurring occurrence of ferocious natural trials. Keeping in mind the obliteration caused by these catastrophes, the building industry has taken charge to make the architecture industry more robust than ever. In this regard, architects are operating to face the challenging precincts levied by natural disasters. New techniques and approaches are already under experimentation. The use of bamboo and afflicted land is the worthiest to mention for the restoration of the land. Notably, both can put up the ferocity of natural disasters as well as to lessen the deprivation of mass housing in third world counties.</p>
<h3>Architecture Robots and 3d Printers</h3>

<p>With the rapid evolution in the field of science, we have applauded its sways in every field. The scientific evolution is also fetching advancement in the architectural domain. Robots and 3d printers are already looming in the architecture industry. We are not distant from the time when automation and human will work collaboratively.</p>
<h3>Vertical Cities</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1783" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min.jpg" alt="Vertical Cities future of the architecture" width="1040" height="1300" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min.jpg 1040w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-240x300.jpg 240w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-768x960.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-370x463.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-185x231.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-740x925.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-20x25.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-400x500.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image005-min-38x48.jpg 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /></p>
<p>With the menacing increase in the world’s population, we are going to face scarcity of land. The rapid increase in population and ecological changes are the prominent factors in the dwindling of earth. An increase in the construction of homes for the accommodation of more people will limit the natural resources, threatens wildlife, and intimidates the ecosystem.  To cope with this alarming situation, architectural intellectuals are of the view to promote the idea of vertical cities to make life sustainable in the busy cities. The vertical city or high-rise buildings can only halt the destruction of natural resources and the dwindling of earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What to do with your Wanderlust in the prevailing lockdown? This question has haunted the wanderers and nomads. Being stuck at their homes, all courtesans of tourism and explorers have no way to appease their wanderlust. Nonetheless, ‘Stay home, Save Life’, has truly become the most popular as well as poignant phrase of the era. As a consequence, the global tourism industry is plunged into an abyss. The constant assertion of this phrase has intensified the wanderlust of wanderers. As a result, staying at home has become a nightmare for tourists. Due to the lockdown, the tourism industry has witnessed the most fecund spring. The people with itchy feet are frazzled as they are forced to halt in times of blossoms. But we have good news for all people who are crept by this lockdown and it is hard for them to follow the instructions of the government and say temporarily adieu to their hiking boots and uncharted places. Keeping in mind their agitation, we have plumbed down a few ways to roam around the world and to cope with tourists’ pining.</p>
<h3><strong>Virtual Tours </strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1769" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1.jpg" alt="What to do with your Wanderlust in COVID Pandemic" width="627" height="418" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1.jpg 627w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image004-1-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p>The first and foremost solution to mollify your wanderlust in the prevalent crisis is to pledge to discover things form your home. Here is good news for tourists that they can easily gratify their longing for tourism with the help of virtual tours. Being stuck at home does not mean it is impossible to cope with the traveling obsession. As an adherent of the digital world, we have exciting opportunities in the form of virtual tours. Now it is credible to have an expedition of many places without leaving homes. Amongst these places, the Vatican, the Guggenheim in Bilbao, and the Natural History Museum in London are leading in providing online tours to their art centers.</p>
<h3><strong>Explore and plan through Reading</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1.jpg" alt="What to do with your Wanderlust in COVID Pandemic" width="576" height="862" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1.jpg 576w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-370x554.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-185x277.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-20x30.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-400x599.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image006-1-32x48.jpg 32w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>If you have a habit of reading, the best thing you can do is read books about tourism. Reading and approaching good books about tourism will facilitate you to explore alien and uncharted places form home. The lockdown has offered you the best chances to collect information about unexplored places and tourism. You can also make a list of the uncharted places so after the termination of this lockdown; you can visit them without wasting any further time in planning.</p>
<h3><strong>Watch Documentaries</strong></h3>

<p>In case you are not a bookworm, we have another adequate way to calm down your obsession with traveling. As we are living in the digital world, we can get the benefit of it in this hard time. The digital world provides us a vast range of sources to quench our wanderlust. Amongst, access to factual films, tourism-based documentaries, and factual sites about tourism are worthy to mention. This way you can even visualize the places and make prints in your mind.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the national tourism organization of Scotland has produced a short documentary of memories of tourists’ visits to Scotland. Featuring stunning visuals from Skara Brae in Orkney to Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway, from Airlie Monument in Angus to Dunnottar Castle in Aberdeen shire and many others, it is an emblem of hope.</p>
<h3><strong>Pen down about past adventures of traveling</strong></h3>

<p>Another interesting thing you can do to entertain your craving is to write about your past adventures. All tourists must have an extensive record of untold stories from their travels and exploration of peculiar places.  Penning down your past adventures and reviving your memories would be as exciting as embarking on a new journey. This stimulating and exciting act will surely satisfy your wanderlust without leaving home. You can also add a twist in it by sharing it with your friends through social media. It’s going to be a great experience of roaming different places without even leaving your home. The physical journey is forbidden but we are not restricted to embark on a journey into the retreats of our minds and revive some of our exciting hunts and share them with the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the commencement of a new decade and bloom of spring, it is a conventional notion to look forward to the year’s most exciting and enthralling ventures in any domain. Just like other realms, the architectural domain is also expected to have a schedule overcrowded with high-profile fairs, exhibitions, seminars, and openings. Stereotypically, spring is an exhilarating time for the inclusive design and architecture industry. With the massive consternation and dismay, this year the spring has turned this convention upside down and bought not just bruise of blossoms rather a rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus that has also knocked out the world of architecture and the design corporations.

Further down is a non-exhaustive index of architectural occasions, programs, and preambles, converging art, architecture, and design, which have been postponed or annulled due to the prevailing pandemic (coronavirus) conditions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article you will find 5 <strong>myths about counseling</strong> which are listed below</p>
<h3>1- There must be something very wrong with me before I go for therapy</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1692" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001.jpg" alt="Myths about Counseling" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001.jpg 626w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-370x246.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-400x266.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>People often think that very serious mental health issues have to take place before seeking therapy. There is a misconception regarding when is a good time to seek help. The reality is that you don’t need to be struggling with a disorder like anxiety or depression. People seek grief therapy because the loss of a loved one becomes too unbearable, others come for counseling because they feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities. The point is that you don’t need to have a mental health disorder or illness, counseling simple provides a space for you to express your concerns freely and openly.</p>
<h3>2- I should go to a psychiatrist first because they are doctors</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-1693" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png" alt="5 Myths about Counseling" width="701" height="351" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png 553w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-300x150.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-370x185.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-185x93.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-20x10.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-400x200.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-96x48.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>The stigma around therapy is so strong in our society that it is much more socially acceptable to go to a medical doctor rather than counselors or therapists. But the truth is that psychiatrist are the last person you should go to, because their job is to diagnose and prescribe not to give you coping mechanisms or provide support. If you feel you are struggling mentally then it is best to start with going to a therapist, often times they will guide you to a psychiatrist if they feel like you could benefit from one.</p>
<h3>3- Counseling will “fix” me or “cure” me</h3>
<p>The job of a therapist is not to fix or cure anyone and this is very important to understand. People often think that there will be some kind of resolution through therapy or that all their problems will be fixed and they will become “normal”. This is not true at all, therapy is about providing a person with a safe enough environment where one can openly explore all aspects of themselves and find answers from within.</p>
<h3>4- Talking about my problems isn’t going to help me</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1695" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1695" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006.jpg" alt="myths and facts about counseling" width="731" height="505" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006.jpg 553w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-300x207.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-370x256.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-185x128.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-20x14.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-400x276.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-69x48.jpg 69w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1695" class="wp-caption-text">Myths about Counseling</figcaption></figure>
<p>More often than not all people need is someone to listen to them, to be heard, without judgment and without any advice or suggestions. Sometimes we don’t want to visit old wounds, we fear that talking about our problems will only bring up repressed material and we will feel worse. This may be true if you don’t stick with therapy, its important to understand that yes initially things might get worse before they get better but the whole point of therapy is to help you get to a place where you are able to look within yourself and embrace all parts of you, good and bad.</p>
<h3>5- A therapist is like a life coach</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1696" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg" alt="A therapist is like a life coach" width="612" height="393" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg 612w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-300x193.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-370x238.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-185x119.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-400x257.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-75x48.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>This could not be further from the truth and yet it is the biggest misconception I come across in my practice. We are not life coaches, our job description does not include telling you how to live your life or help you make daily decisions, or even life changing decisions. We believe that the client is the expert of their life, they know what’s best for them, they have the ability to choose and decide for themselves. All we must do is provide them with enough empathy, acceptance and understanding in order to nourish their autonomy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many definitions of empathy but the one that comes up the most is “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes”. Sounds simple, right? But what exactly does this statement mean? How can we practice this? Putting myself in someone else’s shoes means that I must understand their perspective, it means I must be able to look at the world through their eyes not my own. Again, this sounds simple but empathy is actually a lot harder than we think.</p>
<p>Previously it was believed that empathy is something we are born with, it is something that is innate, it comes naturally to us, we don’t have to try hard to be empathic, we just are. But if we really think about what empathy is we can conclude that empathy is in fact a skill, it is something that we can learn. Anyone can become empathic through acceptance, no judgment and vulnerability.</p>
<p>Lets breakdown each of these qualities for better understanding. Empathy requires us to not only look at or understand but to actually <em>believe</em> the other persons perspective, this means that whatever they are thinking or feeling must be taken as a reality, as their truth, regardless of how ridiculous or outrageous it sounds. Empathy requires us to put our own biases aside and to truly absorb the pain and emotions as if they were our own, to accept that whatever the other person is experiencing is real for them, therefore real for us too.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1636" style="width: 668px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1636" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001.png" alt="What is empathy?" width="668" height="459" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001.png 668w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-300x206.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-370x254.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-185x127.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-20x14.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-400x275.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image001-70x48.png 70w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1636" class="wp-caption-text">What is empathy?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Empathy means staying out of judgment. Easier said than done! It is extremely difficult to avoid judgment because it is something we have been so engrained to do. We are judged from the day we are born till the day we die and we are encouraged to judge others as well. But judgments stand in the way of being empathic, its important to acknowledge these judgments, to understand where they come from and how they effect our human interactions. We can do this by first understanding what stereotypes we have, what prejudices we have, what preconceived notions do we carry? This part is a bit difficult as it requires us to really look within ourselves and understand the negative side of ourselves. Despite the discomfort of introspection, it is important to challenge all our thoughts and belief. This will help us not only understand ourselves better, and therefore develop empathy towards ourselves, it will help us in accepting others the way they are.</p>
<p>This means empathy is a choice and it’s a very vulnerable choice. Not only does it require us to be open and accepting of ourselves but it also requires us to access deep within ourselves an unconditional positive regard for others.</p>

<p>It’s heartwarming to see the awareness being raised around the topic of <strong>mental health</strong>. While our efforts are not going to waste there is still so much left to do to really eliminate the stigma associated with mental health and help-seeking behavior.  </p>



<p>Most articles I’ve come across in recent times focus on highlighting the importance of mental health. The articles will share some statistics or will explain what is mental health and how we should be paying more attention to it. None of the writers talk about what it&#8217;s like dealing with some suffering from a mental illness or dealing with mental illness themselves. None of the articles focus on educating the reader about the resources available, or what can be done to eradicate the stigma. It&#8217;s like we have been made aware of the problem but we are not given a solution.</p>



<p>I recognize that it is important to share information about mental health in order to create awareness. I believe it is equally important to talk about how we as a society can work together to help those struggling with mental illnesses. It is also important to talk about how families, friends and peer groups can help a person recover and sustain a healthy lifestyle. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists all are great resources to access if you are brave enough to put yourself out there, but typically people are not comfortable seeking help because families are disapproving, society is judgmental and friends are unsupportive.</p>



<p>So what can we do as a society to help these individuals feel comfortable in their own skin? Well, the answer is simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>We can <em>listen </em>to them without judgment and try to understand what’s going on in their head. Don’t offer them advice or solutions, it only makes them feel inadequate as if they don’t know what’s best for them.</li>
<li><em>Support</em> them by not undermining their feelings instead of validating them.</li>
<li>Accept their reality. Even if we don’t agree with what they are feeling or we don’t understand what they are going through is irrelevant, people struggling with mental health disorders just want someone to be there for them.</li>
<li> Practice empathy and not sympathy. Here’s how I see it when you sympathize with someone you are just saying the words, “that sucks” “I’m sorry” “poor you” etc. it requires little emotional support on our part, it’s a quick attempt to make the person feel better without really taking an interest in what’s bothering them. Empathy requires us to be emotionally involved in a person’s problem by making their problem our problem and working together towards a solution. So an easy way to remember the difference between sympathy and empathy is the first letter of the word S and E saying and engaging.</li>
<li>Be <em>kind. </em>Talking to someone who is struggling can be difficult but it’s important to remember that a few kind words can mean the world to someone dealing with a mental illness. Your patience will help heal then, and your kindness can ease their anxiety. It doesn’t take much to be kind.   </li>
</ul>

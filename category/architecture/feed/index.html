<p>Noor Mahal is one of many attractions of Bahawalpur. Noor Mahal is a great palace which was built by the fifth ruler of Bahawalpur State, Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq or also known as Shahjehan of Bahawalpur, who was famous for his passion of constructing beautiful buildings.</p>
<p>Noor Mahal is an exquisite building inspired by Italian construction style which makes it one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur and was built under the supervision of a British Engineer named Heenan in 1875 at a cost of approximately  Rs1.2 million. The palace is extremely famous for its colorful and exquisite exterior made of cut and dressed bricks that make this an even unique piece of historical architecture. Noor Mahal’s distinctive architectural feature is the use of five domes built in a very traditional and classic style.</p>
<p>Since its construction, the palace has increased Bahawalpur’s popularity among tourists, who swarm this place every day to have a glimpse of the extraordinary vintage prodigy.</p>
<p>Noor Mahal is one of the latest monuments in Punjab that was positioned under the Antiquities Act. It was built for the residence of Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq but later on, he did not live in the palace as the royals did not prefer to live near a graveyard. As there was a graveyard named Basti Muluk Shah, which was located a few meters away from the place. Later on, the palace was used as the state guest house. During Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq’s tenure, occasional cabinet meetings were held in the Noor Mahal as well. On some occasions, the palace was used as the State Court as the Nawab would address his courtiers and the army during the time of wars.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure of Noor Mahal:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1956" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002.jpg" alt="Structure of Noor Mahal" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-740x493.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Noor Mahal was built in the middle of an extensive and spacious garden that has a water tank and fountains in it as well. The palace consists of 32 rooms, it also includes a basement, 6 verandas, and 5 domes. When the construction was once completed, the palace was decorated and graced up with thick beautiful carpets and a lot of paintings made by western artists. The design comprised features of Corinthian and Islamic styles of architecture with a flavor of sub-continental style. The Corinthian touch is visible in the columns, balustrade, pediments, and the vaulted ceiling of Durbar Hall. The Islamic style is very prominent in the five domes, whereas the angular elliptical shapes are with a touch of subcontinent style.</p>
<p>The palace has two stories and both the stories are decorated exquisite furniture and fixtures like chandeliers and beautifully designed cupboards that were imported while it also enriched with a great collection of arms in its armory.</p>
<p>Some of the swords and muskets are also on display inside the palace, for tourists, as part of the Mughal traditions. In 1906, a mosque was also added to the palace by Nawab Bahawal Khan, a later ruler of the state of Bahawalpur. He also renovated the structure of Noor Mahal at cost of Rs100,000.</p>
<h2><strong>The debacle of Noor Mahal:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1957" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004.jpg" alt="The debacle of Noor Mahal" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-768x576.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-800x600.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-740x555.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>According to an ancient tale, a property dispute took place among the heirs of the last ruler of Bahawalpur which led to the abandonment of <strong>Noor Mahal</strong> as well as several other buildings of that area. The palace was locked down under a judicial order but a lot of the artifacts from the palace were smuggled out somehow. A lot of its furniture, carpets, paintings, and crockery were stolen and sold by thieves almost all over the country.</p>
<p>When Bahawalpur State was merged into Pakistan in 1956, the Auqaf department took over Noor Mahal. Later on, the palace was given into the custody of the Pakistan army in 1971 and in 1997 the Pakistan Army purchased it for the sum of 119 million.</p>
<p>After that, the building of Noor Mahal was declared as a “protected monument” of Pakistan in September 2001 by the Government of Pakistan&#8217;s Department of Archeology. It is now open for tourists around the world, general local visitors, student’s trips, and other interested persons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ranikot fort &#8211; A hidden architectural Gem of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tourism has been given a lot of importance in the past two decades by developing states all around the globe. One of the countries that were least expected to be a desirable tourist location was Pakistan, due to its non-secure image in the global world. However, the country has worked hard to improve its image and had been ranked as the number 1 travel destination by the United States-based luxury and Lifestyle publication. Pakistan covers different landscapes and has various weathers that one may experience during the travel through the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has gained most of its popularity due to the northern regions of Gilgit Baltistan and KPK province. As these are the famous areas of Pakistan which the locals know about and the international tourism community is aware of. However, many other places carry historical importance and are very significant in terms of architecture. The region/land known as Pakistan has seen a lot of different leaders of the regions who were of different ethnicity before the freedom. So, the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/5-best-places-to-visit-in-pakistan/">architectural sites of Pakistan</a> can be a point of attraction for tourists and the people of interest.</p>
<h2><strong>The Great Wall of Sindh:</strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg" alt="Ranikot Fort - The wall of sindh" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-300x169.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-768x432.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-370x208.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-800x450.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-185x104.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-740x416.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-400x225.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-85x48.jpg 85w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h2>
<p>Most of the population of the world is aware of the Great Wall of China due to its features and history but there are very few who know about the Great Wall of Sindh in Pakistan. The Great Wall of Sindh is the outer boundary of a fort which is known as Ranikot Fort. The length of the fort is more than 31 Km’s and it was declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. One may be amazed to know that Ranikot fort holds the title for the largest fort in the world as well. The fort ramparts are usually compared to that of the Great Wall of China.</p>
<p><strong>Ranikot Fort</strong> is about 90 Km&#8217;s from the city of Hyderabad and about 2 hours of drive from the city Karachi. It lies in Jamshoro district Pakistan and it is situated in the second largest national park of Pakistan (Kirthar National Park). The fort is a marvel for the people who have an interest in history and architecture. One side of the fort is covered by rocky hills and the other three sides are covered by tall walls, the walls of the fort are interspersed with bastions and we can the towers on three different spots are semicircular. The most interesting factor of this fort is that this fort has another small fort at the heart which is called the Miri Fort. It is about 3 Km&#8217;s inside from the main gate. The small fort is said to be the residence of the Mir Royal Family.</p>
<p>The structure of the entire fort is made with stone and lime mortar. The walls of the fort are not in a straight line, rather they are built-in zig zag with 4 gates for entry into the fort. Two gates were built parallel to each other, they are built in such a manner that the Sann River crosses diagonally both the gates. The river s along with the skirt of the gates making it difficult to be breached. The other two gates have multi-leveled doors that have floral ornamentation and carved stones on the walls. The main gate is well preserved and can be climbed to get a great view on both sides of the fort. The fort is said to be constructed in 1812 for 1.2 Million Rupees at that time in history. It is a very huge project that was completed at that time. It was the last capital of the Amirs of Sindh. The initial base of the fort had been laid down by Sindh Archeologists but there were renovations made in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century by the Talpur Mirs.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Visit Ranikot Fort:</strong></h2>
<p>The fort carried great importance in the history of the region and is the largest for the world, one should visit to see that how structures were constructed over such a huge land area back in the times. The carving of the stone has been recognized by different organizations among the best carvings of the world from historical times. The location of the fort is something that makes it more attractive as there is barren land on one side of the fort and we see an entire river flowing on the other side.</p>
<p>The architecture of the structure is unique and special in its way, with multi-layered doors, the semi-circular towers, and a fort within a fort. The reason for its construction is still unknown but it must have been home to a huge population and the architects who constructed this fort must have been very skilled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Featuring the influential but simple, imposing, and visually hooking structures with exaggerated blocks, compact concrete edgings, and bold aesthetic individuality, Brutalist architecture is difficult to twig at first sight. One of the most eminent features of the <strong>Brutalist architecture</strong> is that it is endorsed to give prominence to purpose over form and stripped-back plainness over ostentatious designs.</p>
<h2><strong>What is brutalist architecture?</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1922" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2.jpg" alt="What is brutalist architecture" width="623" height="467" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-370x277.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-2-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The word ‘brutalist’ is derived from a French catchphrase that is béton burt that means the raw or incomplete concrete. However, the brutalist edifices are associated with the showcasing of raw and unfinished concrete materials without adorning of any decorative elements. Additionally, the buildings constructed according to this style of architecture are also characterized by minimalistic architecture. As the name suggests, the minimalist buildings are constructed with the unadorned and raw building constituents. Consequently, the minimalist buildings or the buildings categorized by the Brutalist architecture display the prominent structural elements due to the use of bare construction material.</p>
<h2><strong>Genesis of the Brutalist Architecture</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1923" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2.jpg" alt="Genesis of the Brutalist Architecture " width="624" height="832" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2.jpg 624w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-370x493.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-185x247.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-20x27.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-400x533.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-2-36x48.jpg 36w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Brutalist architecture is the eminent architectural style of the bygone days in Great Britain. This style of architecture emerged amongst the reconstruction ventures of the postwar era. This is how the Brutalist architecture or Brutalism has become an illustrious trend of the 1950s. The style got preferable endorsement in municipal projects and official buildings and the form of monuments. Categorically, Brutalist architecture remained in the limelight till the mid of the twentieth century. Emerging from the postwar era it was grown out as the early-twentieth-century modernist movement in the construction industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Famous Wonders of the Brutalist Architecture</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1- Cite Radieuse, France:</strong> Cite Radieuse is peculiarly the domiciliary development and the most influential structure of the Brutalist architecture. This high-density building was designed by Le Corbusier in 1952 that is located in Marseille, France. Being the most quintessence brutalist edifice, it is recognized as one of the most successful and famous works of Le Corbusier. Moreover, the building is also ascribed to be the preliminary inspiration behind the architectural style of Brutalism.</p>

<p>Trellick Tower was designed by the famous architect Ernő Goldfinger and completed in 1972. The tower is a thirty-two storey tower. The fetish of this tower is that it was built to accommodate the survivors of World War II. The purpose of its construction is to provide the modern and affordable residential to these homeless people of London. After a few years of its construction, the tower was considered the ugliest edifice in the world. However, later, the Trellick Tower was triumphed to receive the Grade II heritage status in 1998.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dancing House or also known as Fred and Ginger is in the city of Prague in the Czech Republic, it is the building for the national Netherland in the region. The building has been designed by two architects from different regions: Vlado Milunic from Croatia-Czech and the other was an American Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The design of the building is so different and unique that one is not able to understand whether to praise or criticize it. The building was designed in 1992 and it took four years to complete the construction. Prague is famous for building designs related too gothic, baroque, and even Nouveau. Even though there was a lot of criticism from the entire region but the people living close to this construction site were in favor of it, hoping that one day it will become a culturally important building enhancing the activities of the region. The name that was initially given to the building was Fred and Ginger based on two famous American dancers but the idea was dropped as it may offend the local people of the region for not boosting the local talent or stars.</p>
<h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1899 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004.jpg" alt="History" width="623" height="413" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-300x199.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-370x245.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-400x265.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The location of the dancing house carries great importance as it was built on the area where a house was destroyed by the US bombing in Prague during 1945. Around 15 years the damaged property was not given importance and then a famous architect presented the idea to the semi owner of the land that what he had in mind. He was a neighbor to this land area as well, and he came into some power in the later years. His influence and connections helped the architect give shape to his ideas with all the support. This man was little known as Václav Havel. He was a well-known leader and later became the president of Czechoslovakia. Due to the history of the land the Dutch insurance company had agreed to sponsor the funding required for the building. The sponsorship required teaming up with a famous architect from another region, a few architects declined the offer as the land area was very small, but the American Canadian Architect took up the challenge.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure of the Dancing House:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1900" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006.jpg" alt="Structure of the Dancing House" width="623" height="776" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-241x300.jpg 241w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-370x461.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-185x230.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-20x25.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-400x498.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-39x48.jpg 39w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The dancing house is structured in a very nontraditional method known as deconstructivist, the shape of the building is very unusual, and the dancing shape of the building is supported by 99 concrete panels. Each of the concrete panels had to be designed in a unique and specific way with different shapes and dimensions. The top of the building is made of twisted metal known as Mary. In the middle of all the square and rectangle buildings, this odd building had two major parts. Curved pillars that had been placed to support the glass towers, the second is what runs parallel to the river with unique moldings and widows that are not aligned with each other.</p>
<p>A tower made of rock is used to represent one of the dancers and there is a metalhead that is also placed on top of it. The second dancer is represented through the glass tower. An attempt to make a three-dimensional effect had been made by architects, the windows had been placed in such a way that it is difficult to understand how many floors are there and in a way that it should look very different and unique from the building around it. The building is based on 9 floors where two floors are underground.</p>
<h2><strong>Interior of the Dancing house:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008.jpg" alt="Interior of the Dancing house" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008.jpg 624w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-300x169.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-370x208.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-185x104.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-400x225.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-85x48.jpg 85w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>The exterior and the interior have been done by different architects, the interior was mostly done by a British architect, Eva Jiřičná. Due to the unusual and irregular shape of the building, the internal structure of the rooms was very asymmetric as well. The lobby and the first floor had been designed for commercial purposes, six of the floors for office spaces, and the top floor for a restaurant. The top was meant to be the restaurant due to the view from the windows. The building is uniquely designed like the internal of a ship with narrow hallways to make more space for the offices, as the building is very narrow due to the structure.</p>
<h2><strong>The Dancing House Today:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1902" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009.jpg" alt="The Dancing House Today" width="1135" height="757" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009.jpg 1135w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-800x534.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-740x494.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1135px) 100vw, 1135px" /></p>
<p>As of today, the dancing house has been renovated to a 21-room luxury hotel with the restaurant on the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. The restaurant is named after Fred and ginger, the dancers. There is a bar on the 8<sup>th</sup> floor which is made entirely on the glass. The building exterior and interior are considered a piece of art and now the building even has an art gallery in the building.</p>
<p>The Dancing house has been honored with its feature on a 2,000 Czech Koruna coin issued by the national bank. The design of the dancing house has won the design contest by Times Magazine in 1997 and is known as one of the five most important buildings by the architectural community.</p>

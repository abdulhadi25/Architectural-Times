										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything around us is changing. Our lives have been altered in ways we don’t even understand yet, it’s okay to feel scared.</p>
<p>While many are quick to adjust to this new normal, it’s important to understand not everyone is able to adapt so quickly. It’s okay to take your time. It’s okay to feel lost.</p>
<p>As humans, we all have our own ways of dealing with things. It’s okay to be different.</p>
<p>If it seems like everyone around you is handling the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/what-to-do-with-your-wanderlust-in-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarantine</a> better than you. It’s okay to breakdown.</p>
<p>At a time where the world has stopped but life goes on it’s okay to not be productive. It’s okay to do nothing.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel like nothing is in your control, and it’s okay to want to give up.</p>
<p>If you lay awake at night paralyzed with the fear of the unknown. It’s okay to worry.</p>
<p>When your legs are tired and your shoulders burdened with the weight of the world. It’s okay to rest.</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms over us like a sword hanging from a thread, it’s okay to feel terrified.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contain your emotions and feel them spilling out everywhere, it’s okay to be sensitive.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have been trying to control your feelings, I want to tell you it’s okay to surrender.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel scared, it’s okay to feel lonely, it’s okay to feel helpless, it’s okay to feel angry, it’s okay to feel frustrated, it’s okay to feel sad, it’s okay to lose hope, it’s okay to cry!</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to process what is happening in this world. But it’s extremely important to understand that it’s okay to feel!!</p>
<p>Whatever it is that is brewing inside you, it’s okay to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Many of us have no idea where to go from here and that’s okay.</p>
<p>The beauty in this whole situation is that we are all in this together and together we will be okay.</p>

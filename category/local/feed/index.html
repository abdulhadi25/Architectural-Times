The estimated construction cost of this iconic mosque was 4 billion. Blissfully, the Grand Jamia Masjid Lahore was also entitled as Pakistan’s largest mosque, before the commencement of the Grand Jamia Mosque Karachi’s construction.</p>

<p>The world’s third-largest Mosque has exclusive minutiae as the architecture of the mosque is mingling of Mughal, Persian, Chinese and Turkish architecture. Howbeit, the architecture of the mosque is of great significance since it’s the hodgepodge of distinct architectural blueprints. This exclusive fusion amplifies the grandeur of the mosque and nominates it as a crowning achievement. The Grand Jamia Mosque covers an area of 50 acres at the top of a 60 ft (18 m) high. The site of the mosque is fundamentally worthy of making it palpable from miles away. Likewise, the design of the mosque is an absolute chef-d&#8217;oeuvre in the domain of architecture that includes a 325 ft (99 m) long minaret. Additionally, it has 150 feet high steel structured dome; the tallest Dome in Pakistan. The interior of the mosque is also worth-appreciated as the Kofi Calligraphy is used for the décor of the mosques, embellished with Sindhi styled woodwork and Glass art.</p>
<h3><strong>Rudiments of the Grand Jamia Mosque, third-largest mosque Karachi</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1758 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010.jpg" alt="Rudiments of the Grand Jamia Masjid" width="624" height="468" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010.jpg 624w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>The iconic building of the mosque has a magnificent look due to the fusion of the world’s great architectural styles. Also, having an amalgamation of Mughal and European architectural styles, the mosque has a spell-binding look and design. The rudiments of the grand Jamia mosque include an international state of the art air-conditioning university, along with an Islamic cultural center, <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/museum-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">museum</a>, and a research center. The Grand Jamia Mosque has five colossal and Mughal chic entrances leaving a majestic impact on the worshippers. Among many particulars, the mosque is predominately venerable for having a separate basement that will be solely dedicated to females to offer their prayers. The majestic mosque has 150 domes and 12 implausible types of Natural Stones and titles are being used, and are originally fetched from Lasbella, Baluchistan. Thence, the Grand Jamia Mosque is rapidly completing its various stages of development and it is predominately going to be an accurate tiara jewel of not only Bahria Town Karachi but entire Pakistan.</p>
<h3><strong>Majesty of the Grand Jamia Mosque, Karachi </strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1759 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012.jpg" alt="World’s Third Largest Masjid" width="623" height="302" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-300x145.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-370x179.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-185x90.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-20x10.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-400x194.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-99x48.jpg 99w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The majesty of the Grand Jamia Mosque is evident from its structure, design, site, area, and fusion of the world’s tremendous architecture styles. It is believed that the mosque is majestically going to be the world’s Third <strong>Largest Mosque</strong>, surrounded by hefty gardens which are fenced by arch-shaped walls on all four sides. Subsequent to the Masjid-al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah and Masjid-e-Nabvi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina; the two biggest Mosques in the world, the grand Jamia Mosque is going to be the third-largest mosque in the world paving a way of victory. However, there is no ambiguity in the fact that there can be no Mosque more divine than the former two mosques respecting their sacredness. But the splendor of the fact is that the Grand Jamia Mosque Karachi is pompously subsequent to the world’s most sacred and sanctified places. Thence, it is a great honor and privilege for the architecture of our country.</p>

Verily, the province offers a vast variety of scenes and opens a realm of fascinating views. Though, the province is not getting the deserving aggregate for its magnificence.

<p>The mere popular visiting point of Balochistan is Ziarat, which is also recognized as the best place to escape the scorching heat of summers due to its delightfully cool meteorological conditions. With all its grandeur,  the place has a historical significance as it is associative to the shrine of a local saint whose name was Kharwari Baba. Howbeit, the tag “Ziarat” literally means “Shrine.” The place is occupied with a number of the comfy rest houses banquet throughout the area. The eminence of these rest houses is that they are carpeted with lavish green turfs that are dotted with cherry trees producing mouthwatering and juicy fruit which are free to pick and eat. The land possesses the second biggest Juniper forest in the world. Significantly it is considered to be more than 5,000 years old. These add to the scenery by varying the landscape and look exquisite in the winters when they are topped by snow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adjacent to the federal city, there is an antique destination, Taxila, known for its relics and remnants of an ancient civilization. Taxila, for thousands of years, relished massive admiration as the epicenter of art, education, architecture, and sculpture in Buddhism. Taxila is home to thousands of ancient sites, historical sacred places, Buddhist Sculptures, earth-shattering specimens of architecture, and many archaeological sites. Thence, Taxila is essentially a gateway to explore archeological wonders, a number of specimens of art and sacred places. One of them is the <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong>, one of the vital specimens of architecture, which exhibits the ancient ruins of civilization. It is pretty scarce to acknowledge that the <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong> appears to have been a sacred place of Zoroastrian in the heart of Buddhist Civilization.</p>
<h2>Essential Clue of Ancient Civilization</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1586" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002.jpg 640w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Contiguous to Taxila, there situates an ancient Temple named <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong> which is an exclusive destination for the adorers and seekers of history. The Jandial Temple Taxila is a historical consecrated place, located near Taxila. This historic temple is predominately exhibiting the ancient ruins of the ancient Civilization of Greeks. Verily, the Jandial temple is an integral prodigy of Greek Civilization show-casing the architecture designs of the ancient time. Thence, it is home to a wide range of staggering relics and the ancient ruins of the Greek architecture and Zoroastrian religious rituals. The mingling of two distinctive entities amplifies the fame of <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong>.</p>
<h2>Jandial Temple Taxila; A Momentous Specimen of Architecture</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1587" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2.jpg 600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The temple is certainly anticipated as a Zoroastrian temple. The structure of the temple is replicated from the paradigm of the temples of classical Greece. The Janidal temple is set up on a synthetic embankment which greatly resembles the classical temples of Greece. The semblance of the Jandial temple to the ancient Greek temples is prominently arresting. The structure of the temple consists of a central shrine with four lonic columns supporting a porch. The foremost shrine is rectangular in plan whereas the wall is solid masonry with perforated window openings which peculiarly intensifies the spell of its architecture.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable features of this consecrated site is the architecture and arrangement of the range of shrines and lonic columns within it. Per contra, the eccentric architecture of the Jandial Temple Taxila is one of the reasons for its peculiarity even after so long. For that, it is measured as one of the unique specimens of the architecture. Verily, the temple is also ominously feted as a <em>Semi-Classical </em>temple. Howbeit, the design of the temple is essentially taken from the Greek Architecture of temples, with the segregation of inner and frontier chambers. In the present temple, the frontier chamber is replaced by two lonic columns which are framed by the two antae (specific posts or pillars on either side of the doorway of Greek temples) walls.</p>
<h2>Jandial Temple Taxila Antique Profundity</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1588" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila Antique Profundity" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-800x534.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-740x494.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The structure of the Jandial temple is unique in Punjab due to its Greek quintessence and is taken as an altar. Historically, the Jandial Temple is one of the hallmarks of antique historical architecture which was constructed in the lonic edict. Since there is no exact alignment regarding the period of its constructions. However, it is assumed that the construction of the temple was initiated in the <strong>1st century</strong> BC. Hither to, Jandial Temple Taxila was traced and reconstructed by Indo Greek Kings Demetrius and Menander in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Zoroastrian Temple in the Core of Buddhist Civilization</h2>
<p>Taxila is considered a cradle of Buddhist Civilization replete with its relics and ruins. However, there is oddly situated a Zoroastrian temple in the core of Buddhist Civilization. Consequently, the Jandial temple is getting popularity and becoming a public-eye for the seekers of an ancient civilization. Indeed, the Jandial temple is a paragon of remarkable freakishness.</p>

<h2>Dynamism behind Conquest of SOS Children’s Village</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1580" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007.jpg" alt="Dynamism behind Conquest of SOS Children’s Village" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007.jpg 1920w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-800x533.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-740x493.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1110x740.jpg 1110w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>To chase their motive, they are striving hard to polish their character, personality, abilities and, manners. The school is endeavoring to provide them a normal and secure life that was taken from them by the horrible earthquake of 2005. The efforts of SOS Children’s Village are visible and the enthusiasm is enormous. One of the most remarkable and appreciating contributions of the school is providing them a family environment. It all is just because of their revolutionary objectives, dedication, and keenness. Thence, students do not feel lonesome rather more secured and protected. Consequently, they feel and enjoy a sense of belonging which is truly important for their personality building. Howbeit, the children learn moral values, share responsibilities and form life-long relationships. Since the family environment provides them a compacted and concrete foundation on which they can establish their lives.</p>
<h2>A Lucrative Corporation</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1581" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009.png" alt="A Lucrative Corporation" width="820" height="312" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009.png 820w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-300x114.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-768x292.png 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-370x141.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-800x304.png 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-185x70.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-740x282.png 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-20x8.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-400x152.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-126x48.png 126w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p>Working for the welfare of children, the institute is also paying heed to their moral development of character and personality.  This is truly a humane endeavor to give veracious direction to their instincts. The focal aim of SOS Children’s Village is to assist them in becoming morally and ethically virtuous individuals. For that, the management of the SOS Children’s Village is direly pinpointing their religious upbringing. Religious edification is an integral component of the school. In addition to this, Extra-curricular activities are also devised which includes sports and musical events, scouts and girl guides, games, cooking and art classes. These extra-curricular activities exert as a positive reinforcement to the children who have taken a bumpy ride in the bygone days. Children are also sporadically taken to trips as well. Since some of the children have gone through miserable and tough times, or come from neglected and sometimes ferocious circumstances, the facility of psychological counseling is also offered to resolve their mental issues. Verily, the SOS Children’s Village is an endorsement of triumph.</p>
<h2> A Pledge of Magnanimous Outlook</h2>

<p>Notable that the organization is not just providing them shelter but also taking care of their basic needs. The school has taken the accountability of their secured future and notably fulfilling each and every commitment. Children are shielded from moral exploitation or any sort of abusing conduct and are kept safe during in any circumstances. Howsoever, all the primary and secondary needs of children are sought to be satisfied with their sound development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Saints and stories</strong> &#8211; My grandmother, having lived in Multan for a couple of years, would always say that there’s something in the air there, it makes you feel that you’ve traveled to a different time in history –it makes you feel strangely perturbing yet fascinatingly engrossed.                             </p>



<p>As a child, I would spin stories in my head about the city of <strong>saints</strong>. I envisaged cramped streets bustling with modestly lived lives. I imagined stunning and humongous tombs where <strong>saints</strong> lived. I imagined the stories of the people who lived there. I imagined feeling like it was a different world. I lived with my imaginations for a very long time, knowing one day, destiny would play its trick and I will get to see this folk tale land by my own eyes.</p>



<p>Time passed, life got fast and I moved on.</p>



<p>It was in the summers of 2015 when my Mamu was traveling to Multan for a meeting. I grabbed this opportunity heads on and decided to accompany him.</p>



<p>As we entered the city, the reality was not only gravely disappointing but, also extremely baffling. This was not the enchanting city that my grandmother would tell stories about on Sunday afternoons.</p>



<p>The city had now been injured with littering, crippled with pollution and destroyed by poverty.</p>



<p>Disheartened, I checked in at our hotel. I kept thinking about the city that would get me dreamy in my childhood. The city that harbored Alexander the Great, the streets that were walked by leaders like Mohammad bin Qasim and Mahmud of Ghazni and the land where Sufism thrived. The wanderer in me was not ready to give up just yet, and with that enthusiasm, I set out to see Multan for all that I had imagined it to be.</p>



<p>I had a list of places that I wanted to visit, most of them were shrines of Sufi saints and a small jewelry market for some self-indulgence.</p>



<p>As we began our tour from modern Multan to the old city, the cityscape took a pleasing turn. As the infrastructure got older, the aesthetics became richer. The buildings stood strong and sturdy, put together with red bricks and beautifully decorated with white and blue tiles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1221" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Multani-tile-work.jpeg" alt="Multani tile work" width="600" height="1024" />
<figcaption>Multani tile work</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Every corner spoke of the bounteous history of Multan. The architecture varied charmingly. There were buildings from the Mughal era, there were stunning Hindu temples and gurudwaras and there were imprints of colonialism.</p>



<p>One such building from the colonial area was their much celebrated Ghanta Ghar situated right in the middle of this prehistoric town. Made out of red bricks with white painted stones put together to create exquisite designs and arches and domes that further add to the appeal of the building, the clock tower is an impressive work of the times, unaffected by all that has damaged this city in recent years. The clock tower is surrounded by vibrant sounds, sights and smells and narrow winding lanes of the old city that lead to crowded alleys and bazaars selling vegetables, spices, sweets, silver and handicrafts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1222" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Clock_Tower_Multan_Pakistan-1.jpg" alt="The Clock Tower" width="600" height="910" />

</figure>



<p>Next up were the shrines of Bahauddin Zakariya and his grandson Shah Rukn e Alam, both in striking contrast to the architecture of the clock tower. Both the structures were absolutely breathtaking and stunning, basking in their own elegance. The exterior of the structures were decorated with Multani tiles and the interior was embellished with intricate artwork.</p>

<p>The construction of the both the tombs was completed around the 12<sup>th</sup> century and for someone who is a history buff and appreciates historic architecture, these constructions were gripping to say the least.</p>

<p>The last shrine that I visited was of Shah Shams Tabriz.</p>



<p>This shrine held the most significance for me. I had recently finished reading Forty Rules of Love and the story of Shams and Rumi had left me captivated. It triggered a quest for knowledge of Sufism and spirituality and I couldn’t think of a better initiation of this journey than to visit the tomb of this extraordinary sufi mystic. One of his most beautiful quotes kept going through my mind as we got closer and closer to the shrine:</p>



<p>“You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.”</p>



<p>The way to the shrine was through a loud and vibrant market, so we parked the car right outside the alley and walked our way there. The street leading up to the shrine had carts selling all sorts of things one could think of; clothes, jewelry, shoes, cutlery. It was noisy, deafening, suffocating and extremely hot. At the end of the alley was the door to the shrine. Sitting by the door were people selling roses and candles. The sight itself was bewitching.</p>



<p>As soon as I entered the shrine, the frenzy of the market melted away. The shrine stood completely oblivious to its surrounding. Nothing outside the walls of the shrine mattered to it. It held peace, it characterized spirituality and I knew I was in the right place.</p>



<p>There was a patio at the entrance of shrine which leads the way to the tomb. The floor is of red bricks while some of the walls are white and some are red with artwork of Multani tiles. The shrine was very quiet, only a few people sitting in corners, praying. There was desperation and yet there was tranquility. There was a stillness in the air.</p>



<p>Next to the stairs was a man singing ‘chaap tilak sab cheeni re mo se naina milaikay’ (You&#8217;ve taken away my looks, my identity, by just a glance). I didn’t know if he was there looking for God, for something lost, for something yearned but in that moment, it all felt real. It felt foreign and yet it felt familiar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1229" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez.jpg" alt="The shrine of Shah Shams Tabrez Saints and stories" width="800" height="518" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-300x194.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-768x497.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-450x291.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-225x146.jpg 225w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-20x13.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<p>The architecture and interior of the shrine bespoke Multan’s architectural heritage. The structure was red and blue with huge, almost proud, green dome. The tomb was covered in rose petals and surrounded by lit candles. The artwork on the walls was one of the most beautiful pieces of work I had ever seen in my life. The source of light inside were windows that were carved out in lovely patterns. The mysticism in the air was undeniably overwhelming.</p>

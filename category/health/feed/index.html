										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mental health indicates the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being of a person. It is all about how people feel and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to signify or imply the absence of mental disorders. Living with mental illness is one of the hardest things to do. It is a regular problem without any solution to it. There are treatments like medication and psychotherapy that are incredibly advantageous. Some of the most common self-help recommendations are to exercise, meditate, and be more present, these things seem to work for so many people. However, other proven methods to help fight mental health issues aren’t mentioned as often.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health issues</strong> can affect our daily lives, relationships, and physical health gravely. The most common mental health problems are anger issues, anxiety, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, depression, BPD, OCD, etc. To find the right coping mechanism you need to be patient as it takes time and effort, but it can highly impact how you feel. If you were unable to find successful techniques to help you fight mental illness by yourself, or maybe you want to add a few more to your list, here are a few coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals.</p>
<h2><strong>Accept Your Condition And Find Solution:</strong></h2>
<p>The first stage of curing any mental disorder is to accept the fact that your mental state is not sound or healthy, like any other disease. You cannot change the fact that you have a mental illness, so instead of trying to get rid of it or pretend that it doesn’t exist you need to accept that you have a problem and you need to find a solution to it. Ignoring these problems will only drain your energy. Accept yourself. Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to help yourself take care of it. Either you can go to a doctor or psychotherapist or you can help yourself by doing some exercise.</p>
<p>There are different types of methods for managing mental health problems. Treatment is highly individual, some strategies or treatments are more successful as compared to others. A person who has a chronic mental disorder may choose different treatments at different stages in their life. The individual needs to work meticulously with a doctor who can help them identify their problem and then provide them with suitable treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Early signs of Mental health issues:</strong></h2>
<p>There are so many visible signs of mental illness that anyone can notice as there is no physical test or scan that reliably indicates whether a person has developed a mental illness or not. We should look out for the following signs:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family</li>
<li>avoiding activities that you would normally enjoy</li>
<li>sleeping too much or too little</li>
<li>eating too much or too little</li>
<li>feeling hopeless</li>
<li>consistently low energy</li>
<li>using mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine, more frequently</li>
<li>displaying negative emotions</li>
<li>being confused</li>
<li>being unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or cooking a meal</li>
<li>having persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly</li>
<li>thinking of causing physical harm to themselves or those around them</li>
</ol>
<p>sometimes hearing voices and experiencing delusions</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Treatments:</strong></h2>
<p>There are various types of treatments that can help with mental illness, few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the type of treatment that takes a psychological approach to treat mental illness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy are some of the examples of psychotherapy. Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists are some of the doctors that carry out this type of treatment.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help people fathom the base of their mental illness and start to work on more wholesome thought patterns that help support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation, self-harm, and depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medication</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people who deal with strong mental health issues take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs. Although these medications cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve mental health and symptoms in general and help a person resume his/her social interaction and a normal routine while they work on the improvement of their mental health.</p>
<p>These medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of happy chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Some of these drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation from the brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-help</li>
</ul>
<p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to help themselves and make changes to their lifestyle to improve their condition. These changes might include reducing alcohol intake, improving their sleep cycle, and eating a balanced, healthy diet. Self-help also includes taking out time from work to resolve personal issues that may be causing great damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>People with conditions such as anxiety or depression may benefit from relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness. Having a support system of friends and family can also help a lot in improving one&#8217;s mental state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything around us is changing. Our lives have been altered in ways we don’t even understand yet, it’s okay to feel scared.</p>
<p>While many are quick to adjust to this new normal, it’s important to understand not everyone is able to adapt so quickly. It’s okay to take your time. It’s okay to feel lost.</p>
<p>As humans, we all have our own ways of dealing with things. It’s okay to be different.</p>
<p>If it seems like everyone around you is handling the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/what-to-do-with-your-wanderlust-in-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarantine</a> better than you. It’s okay to breakdown.</p>
<p>At a time where the world has stopped but life goes on it’s okay to not be productive. It’s okay to do nothing.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel like nothing is in your control, and it’s okay to want to give up.</p>
<p>If you lay awake at night paralyzed with the fear of the unknown. It’s okay to worry.</p>
<p>When your legs are tired and your shoulders burdened with the weight of the world. It’s okay to rest.</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms over us like a sword hanging from a thread, it’s okay to feel terrified.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contain your emotions and feel them spilling out everywhere, it’s okay to be sensitive.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have been trying to control your feelings, I want to tell you it’s okay to surrender.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel scared, it’s okay to feel lonely, it’s okay to feel helpless, it’s okay to feel angry, it’s okay to feel frustrated, it’s okay to feel sad, it’s okay to lose hope, it’s okay to cry!</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to process what is happening in this world. But it’s extremely important to understand that it’s okay to feel!!</p>
<p>Whatever it is that is brewing inside you, it’s okay to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Many of us have no idea where to go from here and that’s okay.</p>
<p>The beauty in this whole situation is that we are all in this together and together we will be okay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How To Help A Friend?</h3>
<p>Did you know that people who are at risk of attempting suicide will often ask for help indirectly? That means we have a chance to help someone who is having thoughts of suicide if we pay close attention to what they are saying. But before that it is important that we understand the difference between suicide and self-harm.</p>
<p>Self-harm starts as a coping mechanism for emotional pain and stress, it is often done with the intention to hurt oneself rather than end their life. Self-harm can be very dangerous and addictive, the person self-harming may see it as the only way to express their emotions or deal with life stresses.</p>
<p>Suicide can be thoughts with the intention of ending one&#8217;s life. In other words, a voluntary action that can arise from a person feeling hopeless, depressed, worthless, and they’re in a lot of pain. They may not want to die, but they want to get away from the amount of pain that they feel and see no other way to end the pain.</p>
<p>It is very important that we are aware of the differences in order to be able to help someone who is struggling with thoughts of ending their life. Here are someone of the clues to look out for when determining if someone you know is struggling:</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Signs</strong> – Feeling trapped like there is no way out, no reason for living, no sense of purpose in life. They may make statements like “What’s the point?” “No one cares” “Life is not worth it”</p>
<p><strong>Affective Signs – </strong>Hopelessness, anger, anxiety, agitation, despair, dramatic changes in mood.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Signs – </strong>Looking for a way to kill oneself. For example, seeking access to pills, weapons, or other means.</p>
<p>Talking or writing about death dying or suicide</p>
<p>Engaging in reckless activities or behaviors</p>
<p>Increased drug use</p>
<p>Withdrawing from friends family and society</p>
<p>Unable to sleep or sleeping all the time</p>
<p>This tells us there are a lot of warning signs to look out for which helps increase our awareness and alertness about these symptoms. But there’s even a simpler way for us to remember how we can help someone in need, just use the abbreviation <strong>HELP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong>ear the warning signs: Keep an ear out for statements like “I can’t go on” “I just can&#8217;t do this anymore” “I just want to fall asleep and never wake up” “There is no way out except ending it all”</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>valuate the situation: It&#8217;s best to ask the person directly if they are feeling suicidal. Often times we are afraid of asking directly but its important the person knows you are keeping an eye on them. If the answer to the question is yes then make sure you DO NOT leave the person alone for at least 24 hours, help them access any external support system, i.e. friends or family members they can trust. If not, volunteer to be that person for them for the first 24hours.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong>isten to their reasons for dying but also help them identify reasons for living. Let them know you care, that this is important to you to understand their reasons behind suicide. It is very important to remember that you don’t try to fix their problems, all they need is a listening ear.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>lan- help them make a safety plan and utilize resources. Ask them their plan for the day or night and help them make a step by step plan. For example, ask them to identify 1 or 2 people they consider part of their support system who they can tell about their thoughts of suicide, assist with getting them in touch with a <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/mental-health-action-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a> counselor or therapist. If they are reluctant it is always nice to offer to accompany them to their appointment. This will really help them feel supported and will show them you truly care!</p>

<p>With the menacing increase in the world’s population, we are going to face scarcity of land. The rapid increase in population and ecological changes are the prominent factors in the dwindling of earth. An increase in the construction of homes for the accommodation of more people will limit the natural resources, threatens wildlife, and intimidates the ecosystem.  To cope with this alarming situation, architectural intellectuals are of the view to promote the idea of vertical cities to make life sustainable in the busy cities. The vertical city or high-rise buildings can only halt the destruction of natural resources and the dwindling of earth.</p>

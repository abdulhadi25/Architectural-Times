										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thinking out of the square is a feted and evocative notion. The popularity of the phrase is proportionate to its evocativeness as it coerces to think innovatively, to approach problems from a new perspective, and find solutions inversely. When it comes to the building industry, thinking out of the box means thinking beyond conventional construction flair. In the world of high-rise buildings, sturdy mud architecture is the stoutest combat. The main constituent of sturdy mud architecture is the mixture of mud and straw to form <strong>cob houses</strong>. In the early days of the settlement of human beings, cob was used to build lodgings. With the progression in the architecture industry, the trend of cob or sturdy mud architecture becomes timeworn.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the leanings in the construction industry are ever-changing. New trends of construction and new designs are persistently entering into the mainstream. However, the replacement of the old trends is also reported temporary. Undeniably, new and old trends are sealed in a cyclic casket. The yearning of people for the cob houses is the evidence of this fact. In addition to this, it is investigated that the trend of ultra-luxury habitat is shifting to off-grid housing. People still want to have the houses build-up by the natural building material i.e. cob.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1606" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1.jpg" alt="The exciting story behind colorful Rainbow Village" width="939" height="626" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1.jpg 939w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-740x493.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image005-1-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px" /></p>
<p>The Rainbow Village was originally named Caihongjuan Village established for veteran soldiers. Since the village was not identically populous so the developers wanted to get hold of this abode for their purposes and demolish its beinghood. On this account, one of the residents, Mr. Hung, of village initiated painting his house with the waggish characters and animals in the showy and lavish colors just to make crystal clear to the consultants that he is not going to leave his domicile. When he started off this uplifting bustle his neighbors entreated to paint their homes as well. Nonetheless, this was a sort of remonstration against the consultants. Thence, Mr. Hung kept the village safe by daubing colors on the walls with rainbow colors. Consequently, an enthralling and alluring settlement of 11 original houses is persisted.</p>
<h2>Hues of the Rainbow Village</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Move over Wilshire Grand: A planned 77-story skyscraper wants
to be the tallest building in Los Angeles and west of the Mississippi. That&#8217;s
no accident. </p>



<p>Unlike the Wilshire Grand which was, purportedly, not
intentionally planned to&nbsp;beyond this tallest tower in the city or&nbsp;beyond
this skyscraper was definitely&nbsp;intended to a record-holder, says Jeff&nbsp;DiMarzio,
whose firm DiMarzio Kato&nbsp;Architects is designing the project at&nbsp;Figueroa
and Third in Bunker Hill.&nbsp;“Who doesn&#8217;t want bragging rights?”&nbsp;says
DiMarzio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 1,107 feet, the building would rise&nbsp;just a bit
higher than the 1,100-foot-tall&nbsp;Wilshire Grand. Unlike the Wilshire&nbsp;Grand,
the building at 333 South&nbsp;Figueroa would not use a spire to help&nbsp;it
reach superlative heights.&nbsp;The project calls for converting the 13- story
hotel building on the site into 224&nbsp;market-rate apartments.&nbsp;Planning
documents first spotted by&nbsp;Urbanize LA indicate that the existing&nbsp;two-story
podium and event space&nbsp;would be demolished and replaces with&nbsp;the
skyscraper, which would hold 599&nbsp;hotel rooms, 242 condos, nearly 37,000&nbsp;square
feet of amenities, and almost&nbsp;29,000 square feet of commercial&nbsp;space.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The redeveloped property would&nbsp;contain condos,
apartments, hotel&nbsp;rooms, and event space.&nbsp;“The [new] building had to
be&nbsp;compatible with the existing property”&nbsp;and the elements already on
the site.&nbsp;Considering the needs of the property,&nbsp;architects
essentially “broke the&nbsp;building into geometric halves and&nbsp;tapered it
up to the skyline,” DiMarzio&nbsp;says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The architect says the gradually&nbsp;narrowing
building is sort of like the&nbsp;“sliver towers” that are cropping up in&nbsp;New
York, but on a slightly shorter scale.&nbsp;“The building is simple [and]
elegant”&nbsp;with a composition of low-e glass&nbsp;(which reduces the amount
of ultraviolet&nbsp;light that passes through it) and steel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main body of the high-rise is hotel&nbsp;spacea “mini
convention hotel” with&nbsp;plenty of ballroom space, says&nbsp;DiMarzio. Above
the hotel are condos,&nbsp;which gradually increase in size as the&nbsp;floors
rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topmost floors of the building would&nbsp;hold two
single-floor penthouses, one&nbsp;two-story penthouse, and a rooftop&nbsp;lounge
and bar that&#8217;s expected to be&nbsp;open to the public, says DiMarzio.&nbsp;The
project&#8217;s developer, Shenzhen New&nbsp;World Group, has owned the hotel&nbsp;since

<p>Dubai is synonymous with the cities of the rich as the glamorous
city is home to the highest number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in the
region. </p>



<p>According to New World Wealth, there&nbsp;are approximately over 55,000 HNWIs&nbsp;with $1 million-plus assets, 2,590 multimillionaires with $10-million assets and&nbsp;10 billionaires who have made the&nbsp;emirate as their home. But where do&nbsp;most of these millionaires live in the&nbsp;emirate? </p>



<p>An analysis by the US-based Webster&nbsp;Pacific showed that
the Jumeirah, Umm&nbsp;Suqeim and surrounding areas have&nbsp;the highest
concentration of HNWIs,&nbsp;followed by the Al Karama, Al Raffa and&nbsp;Al
Barsha areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the highest number of rich&nbsp;people lives in Al
Karama, Al Safa,&nbsp;Deira, Trade Centre area, Dubai Marina&nbsp;and Palm
Jumeirah and surrounding&nbsp;areas as these parts of the emirate&nbsp;have
population ratios as compared to&nbsp;other emirates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Dubai has favorable income and&nbsp;wealth tax laws and a plethora of luxury housing, making it an attractive&nbsp;location,&#8221; said Steve Bazant, a consultant&nbsp;at Webster Pacific.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;There are extensive shops and&nbsp;services
across the country for wealthy&nbsp;visitors and no shortage of beautiful&nbsp;beaches.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The emirate&#8217;s total population is just&nbsp;over three million and 55,000 are&nbsp;millionaires, making up 1.8 percent of&nbsp;the total population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the rich people like to live on&nbsp;beachfront
properties which offer not&nbsp;just highly luxurious apartments and&nbsp;houses
but also are in close proximity&nbsp;to the major shopping malls in the&nbsp;emirate.
</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the wealthiest suburbs in&nbsp;Dubai are located close to the beach&nbsp;and offer great views and a host of&nbsp;nearby activities. Also, the apartments&nbsp;and houses in these areas offer top-end luxury and many of them are located close&nbsp;to top-end shopping centers such as the&nbsp;Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates,&#8221;&nbsp;said Andrew Amoils, head of research at&nbsp;New World Wealth.&nbsp; According to New World Wealth&#8217;s recently released report, Emirates Hills, Jumeirah&nbsp;Golf Estate, Dubai Marina and Palm&nbsp;Jumeirah are the affluent parts of Dubai.&nbsp;More than 38,000 millionaires have moved&nbsp;to the UAE over the last 20 years, the report&nbsp;recently said.&nbsp; </p>

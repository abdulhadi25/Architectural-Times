Just imagine life here some 100 years ago when these areas were best known for the people who lived here! Gurdwara, Temple and Mosque, all in one lane, now that&#8217;s what we call pluralism! But then, Partition wreaked havoc. What happened at the time of partition is a heart wrenching, sad history. Today the narrow streets of the city force us to revisit history. They tell us a sorry tale of being neglected and in ruins but still holding itself &#8211; strong.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0It is a glaring fact the old heritage and\u00a0architecture of the city are in complete\u00a0shatters today. Among the overcrowded\u00a0and narrow streets of Bhabra Bazaar\u00a0area of Rawalpindi there lies a historic\u00a0landmark. One of the most magnificent\u00a0architectures of its time, <strong>Haveli Rai Bahadur Soojan Singh<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0Haveli Soojan Singh was built by <strong>Rai\u00a0Bahadur Soojan Singh<\/strong> in 1893 as a\u00a0residence for his family. He was a\u00a0distinguished personality of his era, a\u00a0wealthy business man in Rawalpindi who\u00a0had a flourishing timber business. He had\u00a0a unique sense of architecture and\u00a0design. But this house was not just\u00a0another Haveli. It was a living museum in\u00a0a class of its own. The Haveli was\u00a0deliberately decorated with pictures of\u00a0Rai Bahadur&#8217;s family, antiques, Victorian\u00a0furniture and a milieu of silver and goldware decorated its walls.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The four storied building is divided into\u00a0two parts, either side of the street and the\u00a0roof connected through a bridge\u00a0supported by iron mudguards\/railings\u00a0and decoratively covered with wood.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The wooden artwork on the roof, floors\u00a0and windows is just marvelous.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The covered area of the haveli was 24,000 sq.ft (2,230 sq. meters) spread\u00a0over four stories comprising of 45 rooms\u00a0lit on evenings by huge lamps and\u00a0chandeliers.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to historians, the haveli\u00a0glowed and sparkled like gold in the\u00a0evenings when all these lamps and\u00a0chandeliers were lit in all its massive\u00a0rooms spread over such a huge area.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Historians also say that it was almost like\u00a0a royal palace with a majestic throne\u00a0made of gold and bedrooms furnished\u00a0with ivory furniture. In the courtyards\u00a0tiptoed peacocks and a tiger strolled\u00a0through its corridors. Live music filled the\u00a0haveli in the evenings. The haveli had its\u00a0own water supply system with a waterwell connected to 30 lines.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Shehla Shams, a student of Fatima\u00a0Jinnah Women University, writes in her\u00a0thesis on the Haveli:\u00a0The Soojjan Singh Haveli was initially\u00a0built as a residence for the Rai Bahadur&#8217;s\u00a0family but then it was given to the Sikh generals to be used as a residential\u00a0headquarters. It is a two-storied\u00a0building with two viewing decks on the\u00a0third and fourth floors that were\u00a0probably built as lookout posts by Sikh\u00a0soldiers in the 19th century.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0Made from brick and timber, the Haveli\u00a0reflects traditional building styles of the\u00a0Sikhs of that era. The timber used was\u00a0local and must have been easily\u00a0procured since the Singh family had a\u00a0flourishing timber business. The iron\u00a0used in the pillars and embellishments of\u00a0the doorways was imported from UK.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that stands out about this\u00a0building is that the staircase remains the\u00a0same from the ground floor up to the\u00a0fourth floor. The embellishments of the\u00a0Haveli borrow a lot from Central Asian\u00a0and European architectures. One finds\u00a0intricately carved wooden false ceilings\u00a0on the first floor. The pattern on the\u00a0panels is clearly Central Asian and\u00a0follows the same patterns as the Sethi Mohallas in Peshawar.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years since the partition of the\u00a0Indian Subcontinent it has housed\u00a0refugees from Kashmir until General Ziaul-Haq had it vacated; handing it over to\u00a0nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan to house a\u00a0science college for girls but that project\u00a0for some reasons did not see the light of\u00a0the day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0Later the former Railways Minister\u00a0Sheikh Rashid Ahmed decided to turn it\u00a0into a campus of the Fatima Jinnah\u00a0Women&#8217;s University. However, this plan\u00a0too could not materialize due to its\u00a0present overcrowded location in a busy\u00a0commercial area.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the government is mulling over an\u00a0idea of starting a School of Cultures,\u00a0Heritage, Architecture and Designs for\u00a0girls. This project too may be shelved as\u00a0there are no funds available for it.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The splendid haveli of Rai Bahadur Soojan Singh is in utter shambles these\u00a0days due to lack of proper maintenance.\u00a0One part of the haveli is completely\u00a0damaged. Several parts of the roof have\u00a0collapse and other parts are also\u00a0fragmented. The majestic wood-work\u00a0over the doors and windows are now\u00a0being eaten away by termites and\u00a0seepage through the walls has made the\u00a0whole structure of the building weak\u00a0raising fears that it could fall apart any\u00a0day.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The grand rooms and halls which were\u00a0once bright and echoed of gossips,\u00a0music and laughter now lie vacant\u00a0wearing a ghostly shroud.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The haveli requires extensive renovation\u00a0efforts to restore it to its original glory.\u00a0Today, in place of the dazzling structure\u00a0stands a haunted bungalow. One can\u00a0sense the grandeur of its beauty in spite\u00a0of the skeleton that it is today as through\u00a0the passage of time, it has been robbed\u00a0and looted of its shimmering ornaments.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Haveli Rai Bahadur Soojan singh- Wandering through the narrow streets of old city one could not ignore the amazing architecture of the pre-partition era \u2013 the magnificent buildings, beautiful wooden doors, the Chobaraas and Jharokhas.

Some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/a-tribute-to-the-pakistani-architect-yasmeen-lari\/\">famous architects<\/a> have attended formal architecture education while some have not, but they have achieved such a reputation with their work that they make the formal education un-necessary. <strong>Antoni Gaudi<\/strong> is known as a gem in the architecture industry and was known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernism. He belonged to the region of Spain and there is no evidence regarding any formal education that he had acquired to work in the domain of Architecture. Gaudi&#8217;s work is individualized and does not take influence from the work completed by anyone else, his work is one of a kind and unique. Most of his work has been completed in the city of Barcelona, Spain. The greatest work of his life is also located in Barcelona that is the Church of the Sagrada Familia.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Antoni Gaudi and Modernista Movement:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Antoine Gaudi had a unique way of working and took all the influence from his passions of the architect, religious beliefs, and nature for his work. He considered every aspect of the work that he wanted to complete and have them implemented properly in all categories such as glasswork, ceramics, ironwork, and even woodwork. He was very thoughtful about the environment as well and had introduced new techniques that helped in the treatment of materials such as trencadis, which was used to treat or utilize the broken\/waste ceramic pieces. The work of Gaudi was more inclined towards the Neo-Gothic art and techniques of the oriental side. There was a Modernista Movement which was gaining popularity by the start of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century and Gaudi became an active part of the movement. Being a part of this movement, his work depicted modernism, which exhibited his work to be in an organic form relatable to natural forms.\u00a0 As he did not have formal education, so Gaudi rarely made diagrams or plan sheets for his work, he rather made 3 dimensions of scale modeling and modeled all the details onto it as per his perception.<\/p>\n<h2>Antoni Gaudi\u2019s Work<strong>:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Gaudi has been admired and studied by the new architects since he gained all the popularity of his work. His masterpiece is one of the best creations in the world of architecture even though it is incomplete, the Saragada Familia Church. This church is the most visited monument in the entire region of Spain. After 70 of his death, seven of his projects had been declared as heritage sites by UNESCO, so that the structures are not modified or harmed. His work exhibited his religious following of the Roman Catholic faith that was visible in most. For this specific reason he was named or widely called God&#8217;s Architect, and this further made him work in the same direction.<\/p>\n<h2>La Sargada Familia Church<strong>:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1892 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2.jpg\" alt=\"La Sargada Familia Church-Antoni Gaudi\" width=\"623\" height=\"687\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2.jpg 623w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-272x300.jpg 272w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-370x408.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-185x204.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-20x22.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-400x441.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/07\/image004-2-44x48.jpg 44w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Church is a marvelous site for any person who has the eye of seeing the beauty in any structure, it is an ornate mix of Baroque, Gothic, Moorish and Victorian elements that have been depicted on ornamental tilework.

The ironwork outside the building has been done in iron and it resembles seaweed, there were separate areas to enter for the guests, the animals for carriage and even the servants so that nothing got mixed up. The major attraction is the main living room which had small holes in the high rood ceiling that was used to hang lanterns, this made it look like a starlit sky in the night.

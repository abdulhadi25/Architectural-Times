That means we have a chance to help someone who is having thoughts of suicide if we pay close attention to what they are saying. But before that it is important that we understand the difference between suicide and self-harm.<\/p>\n<p>Self-harm starts as a coping mechanism for emotional pain and stress, it is often done with the intention to hurt oneself rather than end their life. Self-harm can be very dangerous and addictive, the person self-harming may see it as the only way to express their emotions or deal with life stresses.<\/p>\n<p>Suicide can be thoughts with the intention of ending one&#8217;s life. In other words, a voluntary action that can arise from a person feeling hopeless, depressed, worthless, and they\u2019re in a lot of pain. They may not want to die, but they want to get away from the amount of pain that they feel and see no other way to end the pain.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important that we are aware of the differences in order to be able to help someone who is struggling with thoughts of ending their life. Here are someone of the clues to look out for when determining if someone you know is struggling:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive Signs<\/strong> \u2013 Feeling trapped like there is no way out, no reason for living, no sense of purpose in life. They may make statements like \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d \u201cNo one cares\u201d \u201cLife is not worth it\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Affective Signs \u2013 <\/strong>Hopelessness, anger, anxiety, agitation, despair, dramatic changes in mood.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral Signs \u2013 <\/strong>Looking for a way to kill oneself. For example, seeking access to pills, weapons, or other means.<\/p>\n<p>Talking or writing about death dying or suicide<\/p>\n<p>Engaging in reckless activities or behaviors<\/p>\n<p>Increased drug use<\/p>\n<p>Withdrawing from friends family and society<\/p>\n<p>Unable to sleep or sleeping all the time<\/p>\n<p>This tells us there are a lot of warning signs to look out for which helps increase our awareness and alertness about these symptoms. But there\u2019s even a simpler way for us to remember how we can help someone in need, just use the abbreviation <strong>HELP<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>H<\/strong>ear the warning signs: Keep an ear out for statements like \u201cI can\u2019t go on\u201d \u201cI just can&#8217;t do this anymore\u201d \u201cI just want to fall asleep and never wake up\u201d \u201cThere is no way out except ending it all\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>E<\/strong>valuate the situation: It&#8217;s best to ask the person directly if they are feeling suicidal. Often times we are afraid of asking directly but its important the person knows you are keeping an eye on them. If the answer to the question is yes then make sure you DO NOT leave the person alone for at least 24 hours, help them access any external support system, i.e. friends or family members they can trust. If not, volunteer to be that person for them for the first 24hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>L<\/strong>isten to their reasons for dying but also help them identify reasons for living. Let them know you care, that this is important to you to understand their reasons behind suicide. It is very important to remember that you don\u2019t try to fix their problems, all they need is a listening ear.<\/p>\n<p><strong>P<\/strong>lan- help them make a safety plan and utilize resources. Ask them their plan for the day or night and help them make a step by step plan. For example, ask them to identify 1 or 2 people they consider part of their support system who they can tell about their thoughts of suicide, assist with getting them in touch with a <a href=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/mental-health-action-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mental health<\/a> counselor or therapist. If they are reluctant it is always nice to offer to accompany them to their appointment. This will really help them feel supported and will show them you truly care!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How To Help A Friend?

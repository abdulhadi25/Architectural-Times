On that ground-breaking day, we need to commemorate the most outstanding achievement the Muslims of the sub-continent who voted for the Pakistan Resolution on this day at Minto Park, Lahore in 1940. However, the Pakistan Resolution of 23 March 1940 is indisputably a revolutionary event that illuminates the minds of the Muslims of South Asia to raise voice for an independent and sovereign homeland where they could lead their lives following the rational principles of Islam, free from the fear of persecution by the parochial and tyrannical Hindu majority. Howbeit, 23rd march, the resolution day prods us to strive for the upward mobility of our country as per the vision of our <a href=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/letter-from-the-founder-quaid-e-azam-muhammad-ali-jinnah\/\">great leader Quaid<\/a> and the prophecy of Iqbal. This day is a day of festivity of our tremendous triumph over hatred, bigotry, chauvinism, and discrimination. This day urges us to work unruffled for the prosperity, progress, and evolvement of the country that we get after the teeming of sacrifices. The day is alert to remember the notions of our worthiest leader and forefathers that we should strive to exterminate every bit of each evil that is annihilating the foundations of our beloved homeland.<\/p>\n<p>Glumly, we have\u00a0messed up the ideology of Pakistan completely, entirely forgotten the directions of our forefathers. Nonetheless, we need to scrutinize the rudiments of a true jingoistic and demands of this ground-breaking day. For instance, the disproportionate reliance on mortgages and utility from overseas countries cannot go together with a sovereign foreign policy deliberated to serve the best interests of the country and the issues like this needs to be noticed on priority, otherwise, the consequences would go beyond our approach.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the vocation for that Muslims scuffled in 1940; hence not for the way it is in the present 2020, everything is the contradiction of it and messed up. We need to ponder over where is Quaid\u2019s Pakistan? Why we have neglected the visions of the Quaid and the struggles of our leaders? In the emerging years of Pakistan, Pakistan was about to be the <em>Asian Tigers;<\/em> one of the prominent South Asian Countries in the region but now the deteriorating condition of our country needs to be beheld. However, it is veracious time to break the begging bowl and prerequisite to strive for the sovereign standing of Pakistan on its own feet and we are in dire need to exert to acquire a place of deference and poise in the comity of nations. It is our keen responsibility to connect the nation with its roots and keep in mind the ideology of Pakistan because the nations remain flourishing only on the solid foundations of their ideologies. And the nations who overlook their ideologies and the footprints of their forefathers have been drenched to piths. We direly need to permeate the spirit of enthusiasm so that we will be able to mark the triumph of our country.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-1663 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-full'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/the-resolution-day-alert\/image004-4\/'><img width=\"388\" height=\"290\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"The Resolution Day Alert\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1.jpg 388w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1-370x277.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1-20x15.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1-185x138.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image004-1-64x48.jpg 64w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/the-resolution-day-alert\/image005-11\/'><img width=\"229\" height=\"220\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"The Resolution Day Alert\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image005-5.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image005-5.jpg 229w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image005-5-20x19.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image005-5-185x178.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image005-5-50x48.jpg 50w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/the-resolution-day-alert\/image003-13\/'><img width=\"300\" height=\"231\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"The Resolution Day Alert\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image003-7.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image003-7.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image003-7-20x15.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image003-7-185x142.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/03\/image003-7-62x48.jpg 62w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The month of March is a reminiscence of the momentous event in the history of Pakistan.

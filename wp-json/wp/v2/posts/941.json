According to Hindu scripture, it was the deity, Krishna, who selected the grounds for temples and placed a hand-made shivling in it. However, the place is\u00a0not only revered for the Hindus, but also for the Sikhs. The\u00a0founder of Sikh faith, Guru Nanak, visited the temples during\u00a0the early 1800s. Furthermore, the haveli of Hari Singh\u00a0Nalwa, a highly praised General of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#8217;s\u00a0army, lies adjacent to Ram&#8217;s temple. Strangely so, even\u00a0Muslims have their connection to the site, since it was also\u00a0the resting place for the famous Muslim Scholar, Al-Biruni,\u00a0who used to spend time in the temples studying Hinduism.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0The Katas Raj Temples are situated along the M2\u00a0Motorway, near the town of Kallar Kahar. Surrounded by\u00a0blue skies and dense vegetation, the temples are sign of\u00a0reverence for Hindu mythology. Located at an altitude of 2000 feet, the whole complex covers a space of around\u00a0260 kanals. Historical records suggest that construction of\u00a0the complex dates back to the 11th century, when it was\u00a0built under a Kashmiri kingdom.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The location is home to Satgraha, an amalgamation of\u00a0seven temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, five Kashmiri\u00a0style medieval temples, and havelis spread around a pond\u00a0area that holds great significance in the Hindu community.\u00a0According to the Puranas (sacred Sanskrit scripture), the pond\u00a0water comes from the deity Shiva&#8217;s tears, which he shed after the\u00a0demise of his wife, Sati. It was commonly believed that the bright\u00a0blue-green water of the pond could wash away ones sins.\u00a0However, the once clear pond is now subject to eutrophication and\u00a0excessive algal\u00a0growth. The sanctuaries\u00a0at Katas are, for\u00a0the most part,\u00a0built on square\u00a0stages. The\u00a0domes on the\u00a0shrines stand\u00a0tall and are a\u00a0major part of the\u00a0attraction, and\u00a0the grand\u00a0arched\u00a0entrances to the\u00a0temples indicate\u00a0the architectural\u00a0aesthetics that\u00a0went into\u00a0building this\u00a0holy place. One\u00a0of the most\u00a0distinct\u00a0structures is the\u00a0Ramchandra Mandir, which is up to two stories high and\u00a0consists of eight rooms. However, the entire site of Katas\u00a0seems to crumble before your eyes, as you walk across this\u00a0historic landmark. Paint chipped off, cracked domes and bird&#8217;s\u00a0nests everywhere; lack of maintenance has changed what this\u00a0place used to look like. As a place of worship, it seems slightly\u00a0odd that none of the idols have been preserved and kept in the\u00a0temples, though understandably this could be due to dangers of\u00a0vandalism and theft.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The place is rich with Hindu culture, history, and tradition.

Starting with the notion of shelter-building for survival it has now turned into one of the most important amphitheaters of our lives. History has witnessed its evolution from a mere concept of arranging shelter to the most endorsed and esteemed forms of art. Needles to say, the evolution in the respected domain is persisting with the blink of an eye leaving the spectators wondering.<\/p>\n<p>Every adept architect is essentially a great poet and the former of the epitomes of his time, his day, and his age. While representing their age, these epitomes yearn for heir timeless commemoration. However, the role of architecture in the progression of mankind is patent. Each epoch has its customs of planning, designing, building and, preserving its distinctiveness. Over time, this progression has also been imperiled to stagy modifications and paved the way to get a glimpse of the future.

Keeping in mind the obliteration caused by these catastrophes, the building industry has taken charge to make the architecture industry more robust than ever. In this regard, architects are operating to face the challenging precincts levied by natural disasters. New techniques and approaches are already under experimentation. The use of bamboo and afflicted land is the worthiest to mention for the restoration of the land. Notably, both can put up the ferocity of natural disasters as well as to lessen the deprivation of mass housing in third world counties.<\/p>\n<h3>Architecture Robots and 3d Printers<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1782 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Architecture Robots and 3d Printers -future of the architecture\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-370x278.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-20x15.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-185x139.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-740x555.jpg 740w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-1600x1200.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/05\/image004-min-64x48.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With the rapid evolution in the field of science, we have applauded its sways in every field.

Noor Mahal is a great palace which was built by the fifth ruler of Bahawalpur State, Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq or also known as Shahjehan of Bahawalpur, who was famous for his passion of constructing beautiful buildings.<\/p>\n<p>Noor Mahal is an exquisite building inspired by Italian construction style which makes it one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur and was built under the supervision of a British Engineer named Heenan in 1875 at a cost of approximately \u00a0Rs1.2 million. The palace is extremely famous for its colorful and exquisite exterior made of cut and dressed bricks that make this an even unique piece of historical architecture. Noor Mahal\u2019s distinctive architectural feature is the use of five domes built in a very traditional and classic style.<\/p>\n<p>Since its construction, the palace has increased Bahawalpur\u2019s popularity among tourists, who swarm this place every day to have a glimpse of the extraordinary vintage prodigy.<\/p>\n<p>Noor Mahal is one of the latest monuments in Punjab that was positioned under the Antiquities Act. It was built for the residence of Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq but later on, he did not live in the palace as the royals did not prefer to live near a graveyard. As there was a graveyard named Basti Muluk Shah, which was located a few meters away from the place. Later on, the palace was used as the state guest house. During Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq\u2019s tenure, occasional cabinet meetings were held in the Noor Mahal as well. On some occasions, the palace was used as the State Court as the Nawab would address his courtiers and the army during the time of wars.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Structure of Noor Mahal:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1956 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002.jpg\" alt=\"Structure of Noor Mahal\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002.jpg 800w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-370x247.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-20x13.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-185x123.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-740x493.jpg 740w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image002-72x48.jpg 72w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Noor Mahal was built in the middle of an extensive and spacious garden that has a water tank and fountains in it as well. The palace consists of 32 rooms, it also includes a basement, 6 verandas, and 5 domes. When the construction was once completed, the palace was decorated and graced up with thick beautiful carpets and a lot of paintings made by western artists. The design comprised features of Corinthian and Islamic styles of architecture with a flavor of sub-continental style. The Corinthian touch is visible in the columns, balustrade, pediments, and the vaulted ceiling of Durbar Hall. The Islamic style is very prominent in the five domes, whereas the angular elliptical shapes are with a touch of subcontinent style.<\/p>\n<p>The palace has two stories and both the stories are decorated exquisite furniture and fixtures like chandeliers and beautifully designed cupboards that were imported while it also enriched with a great collection of arms in its armory.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the swords and muskets are also on display inside the palace, for tourists, as part of the Mughal traditions. In 1906, a mosque was also added to the palace by Nawab Bahawal Khan, a later ruler of the state of Bahawalpur. He also renovated the structure of Noor Mahal at cost of Rs100,000.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The debacle of Noor Mahal:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1957 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004.jpg\" alt=\"The debacle of Noor Mahal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-370x278.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-20x15.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-185x139.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-740x555.jpg 740w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/09\/image004-64x48.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to an ancient tale, a property dispute took place among the heirs of the last ruler of Bahawalpur which led to the abandonment of <strong>Noor Mahal<\/strong> as well as several other buildings of that area. The palace was locked down under a judicial order but a lot of the artifacts from the palace were smuggled out somehow. A lot of its furniture, carpets, paintings, and crockery were stolen and sold by thieves almost all over the country.<\/p>\n<p>When Bahawalpur State was merged into Pakistan in 1956, the Auqaf department took over Noor Mahal. Later on, the palace was given into the custody of the Pakistan army in 1971 and in 1997 the Pakistan Army purchased it for the sum of 119 million.<\/p>\n<p>After that, the building of Noor Mahal was declared as a \u201cprotected monument\u201d of Pakistan in September 2001 by the Government of Pakistan&#8217;s Department of Archeology. It is now open for tourists around the world, general local visitors, student\u2019s trips, and other interested persons.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We always talk about going to different countries to see how beautiful they are but we keep forgetting there are so many cities that are enriched with beautiful historical places and tremendous landmarks.

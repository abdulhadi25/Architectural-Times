One can spot ceramic art, hand-poured candles, bahawalpuri style jhumkay, hand painted coasters and trays and much more. Pakistan inspired products like cushions, tables, paintings and scarves also seem to dominate the trend of the shop. The slogan of the shop says \u2018Quaint and Quirky\u2019 and it delivers.

Today, while much of the market is dominated by large corporations, small businesses offer more diversity, economic growth in small geographic areas and personalized experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the store empowers small business women who specialize in particular products like handmade soaps, pottery, and truck art inspired goods and helps them sculpt their own identity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, the prices at <strong>Kayal<\/strong> are certainly on the high-end and heavy on the average middle-class person\u2019s pocket, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re handmade using high-quality raw material and a lot of hard work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Unique in its nature, Kayal is also one of the first shops to go plastic free and promote environmental awareness. The incessant and reprehensible use of plastic has cost us our planet and stores like <strong>Kayal<\/strong> are really a breath of fresh air for environmental enthusiasts and a remarkable example of ethical retail.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While our country is blessed with skilled artists and great opportunity for growth, unfortunately, because of the staggering socio-economic situation, much of the talent remains untapped. Most companies prefer mass production as it is cost saving, convenient and automated and then there are stores like Kayal that believe in the value of human over machine, the importance of being unique and help create a space where craftsmanship can thrive.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kayal, a hidden secret of Islamabad, is a retail store situated in the busy and bustling Beverley Center.

One can showcase the best possible version in a photograph, add relevant hashtags and with a single tap on their phones, they\u2019ve instantly reach millions of people. Is it possible for people to taste your food by looking at the picture that appeared in their feed? No. But what they can see is, how it is presented and in what setting it is presented in. The ambience and essence of the place can be captured, allowing viewers to decide whether it is the ideal place for them to share a meal with their friends, family or co-workers. With the concept of eateries, now being as the ultimate go to hangout place, retailers would want to stand out to their customers by providing more than just delicious food. Playing with the ambience and altering it for the comfort of their target audience, it can be ensured that they have a good experience overall, making them want to revisit.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-1512 size-full lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004.jpg\" alt=\"Is it only the food served that matters?\" width=\"310\" height=\"202\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004.jpg 310w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004-300x195.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004-185x121.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image004-74x48.jpg 74w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Aiming for a modern and attractive interior can easily overshadow just how essential the layout of a caf\u00e9 or restaurant is to the success of the design. If it fails, the entire functioning of the caf\u00e9 will collapse. It is very necessary to carefully study the ergonomics required for your specific serving style, whether it will be fine dining, casual dining, fast food place or a bistro. It will dictate if serving staff is required or will self-service cater better to your needs. These decisions seemingly small are what your entire seating arrangement is based on. If the server does not have enough space to pass through the aisle or customers cannot back up their chairs without bumping into the person behind them, no matter how attractive or cozy your interior is, it will result in an unpleasant experience. On the contrary, leaving way too much space around, also has a negative effect. It will be a waste of space and make the eatery always appear to be empty, even when it is busy with customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-1511 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-large'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters\/image007\/'><img width=\"366\" height=\"549\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-large size-large thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"Cafe interior design\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007.jpg 366w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007-185x278.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007-20x30.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image007-32x48.jpg 32w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters\/image005-2\/'><img width=\"365\" height=\"547\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-large size-large thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"Best furniture for your cafe\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005.jpg 365w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005-185x277.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005-20x30.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image005-32x48.jpg 32w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters\/image010\/'><img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-large size-large thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"Is it only the food served that matters?\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-683x1024.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-370x555.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-185x277.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-20x30.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-400x600.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image010-32x48.jpg 32w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<p>The furniture chosen should strictly follow the rules of ergonomics. Have you ever been to a restaurant where the table was so far that you had to sit on the edge of your seat through the entirety of the meal or your chair was too low compared to the table that it was causing a strain on your arms, or worse, your chair didn\u2019t have a back rest at all? People looking for a pleasant dinging experience, should be able to enjoy their meal without having to worry about straining their back and arms.<\/p>\n<p>Once, the layout and furniture is sorted, fulfilling the functional needs, the focus can entirely be shifted towards making your interior aesthetically pleasing for the customers. Light holds the power to set the mood of the space. It can make it appear dramatic, cozy, warm or just bright depending on the ambience you\u2019re going for. To make it easier to decide on the type of lighting required, one needs to understand what purpose that certain light fixture will serve; Will it be used to generally illuminate the dining area or will it be in place to compliment the overall theme by functioning as a decorative element or whether it is needed to create emphasis on certain elements of the interior designed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1524 size-large lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"best furniture design for cafe\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-819x1024.jpg 819w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-768x960.jpg 768w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-370x463.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-800x1000.jpg 800w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-185x231.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-740x925.jpg 740w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-20x25.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-400x500.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image012-38x48.jpg 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The perfect blend of natural and artificial light usually does the trick. A space washed by natural light makes it appear open and has a positive effect on the diner\u2019s mood. Along with it, incorporating green elements in your design, by capturing a view of the landscaping around the venue or placing indoor plants can liven up your space, make it visually pleasing and be a source of comfort for the customers. If possible a small area of the restaurant should be dedicated to an outdoor setting. If the weather is pleasant, people will always prefer a place where they can enjoy good food and good weather without having to be locked inside a room, since, it takes away from the charm of the weather. It will also serve as a design element inviting customers to your restaurant when they walk by it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1525 size-full lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014.jpg\" alt=\"best cafe interior design\" width=\"414\" height=\"621\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014.jpg 414w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-370x555.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-185x278.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-20x30.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-400x600.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image014-32x48.jpg 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As much as light is important, so is the theme of your caf\u00e9 which is closely knit with the materials used and the color palette that is followed. It is the reflection of the type of food you serve and decides the age group you\u2019re mainly trying to attract. For example, A dynamic design, including elements such as graffiti, neon props, accent lighting and a bright color palette, hints at a younger age group and will be loud and overwhelming for a family looking for a peaceful place to dine at. On the contrary, use of earthy tones and colors such as grey and white, can serve as a neutral color palette as it doesn\u2019t define a specific age group and welcomes people with varying interests. Colors like red and yellow instantly pop into one\u2019s mind when thinking about a restaurant due to their psychological effect of increasing appetite but it can be hard to incorporate such bright colors in your design while avoiding the discomfort they can cause when not curated properly. Using such colors in a subtle manner, using varying hues, shades and tones, for feature wall, props and furniture, can result in a successful design.<\/p>\n<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-1511 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-full'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters\/image016\/'><img width=\"591\" height=\"589\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"Is it only the food served that matters?\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016.jpg 591w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-90x90.jpg 90w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-370x369.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-270x270.jpg 270w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-20x20.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-185x184.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-400x399.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image016-48x48.jpg 48w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters\/image018\/'><img width=\"403\" height=\"425\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload\" alt=\"Is it only the food served that matters?\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018.jpg 403w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-284x300.jpg 284w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-370x390.jpg 370w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-20x21.jpg 20w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-185x195.jpg 185w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-400x422.jpg 400w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2020\/01\/image018-46x48.jpg 46w\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<p>Textures and materials must also be considered simultaneously when deciding on colors, since, they reinforce the essence one is aiming for. A warm and cozy interior can be taken one step forward by using bare brick or wooden textures where possible. Similarly, metal can be used in eateries that wish to give off a more modern vibe, by combining it with a color palette comprising of greys and white.<\/p>\n<p>It is very easy to get carried away and overdo the interior d\u00e9cor, as you aim for the customers to fully grasp and understand your theme, as soon as they walk in. In wanting for them to understand the intended atmosphere, one might end up using excessive relevant props or make the space appear either too bright or too dull, making it difficult for the customers to stay there for long, let alone consider to revisit. If functionality is kept in mind and a fine line is drawn between minimal and overdone, your eatery will definitely be a success in your community and a hit on Instagram, but don\u2019t forget to make sure that your food still outweighs the aesthetic interior!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram has made it easier to promote your budding caf\u00e9 or restaurant without having to spend thousands on advertising.

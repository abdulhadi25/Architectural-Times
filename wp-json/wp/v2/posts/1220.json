I envisaged cramped streets bustling with modestly lived lives. I imagined stunning and humongous tombs where <strong>saints<\/strong> lived. I imagined the stories of the people who lived there. I imagined feeling like it was a different world. I lived with my imaginations for a very long time, knowing one day, destiny would play its trick and I will get to see this folk tale land by my own eyes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Time passed, life got fast and I moved on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It was in the summers of 2015 when my Mamu was traveling to Multan for a meeting. I grabbed this opportunity heads on and decided to accompany him.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we entered the city, the reality was not only gravely disappointing but, also extremely baffling. This was not the enchanting city that my grandmother would tell stories about on Sunday afternoons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The city had now been injured with littering, crippled with pollution and destroyed by poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Disheartened, I checked in at our hotel. I kept thinking about the city that would get me dreamy in my childhood. The city that harbored Alexander the Great, the streets that were walked by leaders like Mohammad bin Qasim and Mahmud of Ghazni and the land where Sufism thrived. The wanderer in me was not ready to give up just yet, and with that enthusiasm, I set out to see Multan for all that I had imagined it to be.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I had a list of places that I wanted to visit, most of them were shrines of Sufi saints and a small jewelry market for some self-indulgence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we began our tour from modern Multan to the old city, the cityscape took a pleasing turn. As the infrastructure got older, the aesthetics became richer. The buildings stood strong and sturdy, put together with red bricks and beautifully decorated with white and blue tiles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1221 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/Multani-tile-work.jpeg\" alt=\"Multani tile work\" width=\"600\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Multani tile work<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Every corner spoke of the bounteous history of Multan. The architecture varied charmingly. There were buildings from the Mughal era, there were stunning Hindu temples and gurudwaras and there were imprints of colonialism.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One such building from the colonial area was their much celebrated Ghanta Ghar situated right in the middle of this prehistoric town. Made out of red bricks with white painted stones put together to create exquisite designs and arches and domes that further add to the appeal of the building, the clock tower is an impressive work of the times, unaffected by all that has damaged this city in recent years. The clock tower is surrounded by vibrant sounds, sights and smells and narrow winding lanes of the old city that lead to crowded alleys and bazaars selling vegetables, spices, sweets, silver and handicrafts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1222 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/Clock_Tower_Multan_Pakistan-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Clock Tower\" width=\"600\" height=\"910\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>The Clock Tower (<strong>Saints and stories<\/strong>)<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next up were the shrines of Bahauddin Zakariya and his grandson Shah Rukn e Alam, both in striking contrast to the architecture of the clock tower. Both the structures were absolutely breathtaking and stunning, basking in their own elegance. The exterior of the structures were decorated with Multani tiles and the interior was embellished with intricate artwork.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

Bahaudin Zakariya\u2019s shrine<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The last shrine that I visited was of Shah Shams Tabriz.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This shrine held the most significance for me. I had recently finished reading Forty Rules of Love and the story of Shams and Rumi had left me captivated. It triggered a quest for knowledge of Sufism and spirituality and I couldn\u2019t think of a better initiation of this journey than to visit the tomb of this extraordinary sufi mystic. One of his most beautiful quotes kept going through my mind as we got closer and closer to the shrine:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cYou can study God through everything and everyone in the universe because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The way to the shrine was through a loud and vibrant market, so we parked the car right outside the alley and walked our way there. The street leading up to the shrine had carts selling all sorts of things one could think of; clothes, jewelry, shoes, cutlery. It was noisy, deafening, suffocating and extremely hot. At the end of the alley was the door to the shrine. Sitting by the door were people selling roses and candles. The sight itself was bewitching.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as I entered the shrine, the frenzy of the market melted away. The shrine stood completely oblivious to its surrounding. Nothing outside the walls of the shrine mattered to it. It held peace, it characterized spirituality and I knew I was in the right place.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There was a patio at the entrance of shrine which leads the way to the tomb. The floor is of red bricks while some of the walls are white and some are red with artwork of Multani tiles. The shrine was very quiet, only a few people sitting in corners, praying. There was desperation and yet there was tranquility. There was a stillness in the air.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the stairs was a man singing \u2018chaap tilak sab cheeni re mo se naina milaikay\u2019 (You&#8217;ve taken away my looks, my identity, by just a glance). I didn\u2019t know if he was there looking for God, for something lost, for something yearned but in that moment, it all felt real. It felt foreign and yet it felt familiar.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1229 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez.jpg\" alt=\"The shrine of Shah Shams Tabrez Saints and stories\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez.jpg 800w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-300x194.jpg 300w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-768x497.jpg 768w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-450x291.jpg 450w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-225x146.jpg 225w, https:\/\/architecturaltimes.news\/files\/2019\/08\/The-shrine-of-Shah-Shams-Tabrez-20x13.jpg 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>The shrine of Shah Shams Tabrez (Saints and stories)<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture and interior of the shrine bespoke Multan\u2019s architectural heritage. The structure was red and blue with huge, almost proud, green dome. The tomb was covered in rose petals and surrounded by lit candles. The artwork on the walls was one of the most beautiful pieces of work I had ever seen in my life. The source of light inside were windows that were carved out in lovely patterns. The mysticism in the air was undeniably overwhelming.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1230 lazyload\"

<p>Noor Mahal is one of many attractions of Bahawalpur. Noor Mahal is a great palace which was built by the fifth ruler of Bahawalpur State, Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq or also known as Shahjehan of Bahawalpur, who was famous for his passion of constructing beautiful buildings.</p>
<p>Noor Mahal is an exquisite building inspired by Italian construction style which makes it one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur and was built under the supervision of a British Engineer named Heenan in 1875 at a cost of approximately  Rs1.2 million. The palace is extremely famous for its colorful and exquisite exterior made of cut and dressed bricks that make this an even unique piece of historical architecture. Noor Mahal’s distinctive architectural feature is the use of five domes built in a very traditional and classic style.</p>
<p>Since its construction, the palace has increased Bahawalpur’s popularity among tourists, who swarm this place every day to have a glimpse of the extraordinary vintage prodigy.</p>
<p>Noor Mahal is one of the latest monuments in Punjab that was positioned under the Antiquities Act. It was built for the residence of Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq but later on, he did not live in the palace as the royals did not prefer to live near a graveyard. As there was a graveyard named Basti Muluk Shah, which was located a few meters away from the place. Later on, the palace was used as the state guest house. During Nawab Sir Muhammad Sadiq’s tenure, occasional cabinet meetings were held in the Noor Mahal as well. On some occasions, the palace was used as the State Court as the Nawab would address his courtiers and the army during the time of wars.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure of Noor Mahal:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1956" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002.jpg" alt="Structure of Noor Mahal" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-740x493.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image002-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Noor Mahal was built in the middle of an extensive and spacious garden that has a water tank and fountains in it as well. The palace consists of 32 rooms, it also includes a basement, 6 verandas, and 5 domes. When the construction was once completed, the palace was decorated and graced up with thick beautiful carpets and a lot of paintings made by western artists. The design comprised features of Corinthian and Islamic styles of architecture with a flavor of sub-continental style. The Corinthian touch is visible in the columns, balustrade, pediments, and the vaulted ceiling of Durbar Hall. The Islamic style is very prominent in the five domes, whereas the angular elliptical shapes are with a touch of subcontinent style.</p>
<p>The palace has two stories and both the stories are decorated exquisite furniture and fixtures like chandeliers and beautifully designed cupboards that were imported while it also enriched with a great collection of arms in its armory.</p>
<p>Some of the swords and muskets are also on display inside the palace, for tourists, as part of the Mughal traditions. In 1906, a mosque was also added to the palace by Nawab Bahawal Khan, a later ruler of the state of Bahawalpur. He also renovated the structure of Noor Mahal at cost of Rs100,000.</p>
<h2><strong>The debacle of Noor Mahal:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1957" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004.jpg" alt="The debacle of Noor Mahal" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-768x576.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-800x600.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-740x555.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image004-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>According to an ancient tale, a property dispute took place among the heirs of the last ruler of Bahawalpur which led to the abandonment of <strong>Noor Mahal</strong> as well as several other buildings of that area. The palace was locked down under a judicial order but a lot of the artifacts from the palace were smuggled out somehow. A lot of its furniture, carpets, paintings, and crockery were stolen and sold by thieves almost all over the country.</p>
<p>When Bahawalpur State was merged into Pakistan in 1956, the Auqaf department took over Noor Mahal. Later on, the palace was given into the custody of the Pakistan army in 1971 and in 1997 the Pakistan Army purchased it for the sum of 119 million.</p>
<p>After that, the building of Noor Mahal was declared as a “protected monument” of Pakistan in September 2001 by the Government of Pakistan&#8217;s Department of Archeology. It is now open for tourists around the world, general local visitors, student’s trips, and other interested persons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ranikot fort &#8211; A hidden architectural Gem of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tourism has been given a lot of importance in the past two decades by developing states all around the globe. One of the countries that were least expected to be a desirable tourist location was Pakistan, due to its non-secure image in the global world. However, the country has worked hard to improve its image and had been ranked as the number 1 travel destination by the United States-based luxury and Lifestyle publication. Pakistan covers different landscapes and has various weathers that one may experience during the travel through the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has gained most of its popularity due to the northern regions of Gilgit Baltistan and KPK province. As these are the famous areas of Pakistan which the locals know about and the international tourism community is aware of. However, many other places carry historical importance and are very significant in terms of architecture. The region/land known as Pakistan has seen a lot of different leaders of the regions who were of different ethnicity before the freedom. So, the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/5-best-places-to-visit-in-pakistan/">architectural sites of Pakistan</a> can be a point of attraction for tourists and the people of interest.</p>
<h2><strong>The Great Wall of Sindh:</strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg" alt="Ranikot Fort - The wall of sindh" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-300x169.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-768x432.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-370x208.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-800x450.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-185x104.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-740x416.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-400x225.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-85x48.jpg 85w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h2>
<p>Most of the population of the world is aware of the Great Wall of China due to its features and history but there are very few who know about the Great Wall of Sindh in Pakistan. The Great Wall of Sindh is the outer boundary of a fort which is known as Ranikot Fort. The length of the fort is more than 31 Km’s and it was declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. One may be amazed to know that Ranikot fort holds the title for the largest fort in the world as well. The fort ramparts are usually compared to that of the Great Wall of China.</p>
<p><strong>Ranikot Fort</strong> is about 90 Km&#8217;s from the city of Hyderabad and about 2 hours of drive from the city Karachi. It lies in Jamshoro district Pakistan and it is situated in the second largest national park of Pakistan (Kirthar National Park). The fort is a marvel for the people who have an interest in history and architecture. One side of the fort is covered by rocky hills and the other three sides are covered by tall walls, the walls of the fort are interspersed with bastions and we can the towers on three different spots are semicircular. The most interesting factor of this fort is that this fort has another small fort at the heart which is called the Miri Fort. It is about 3 Km&#8217;s inside from the main gate. The small fort is said to be the residence of the Mir Royal Family.</p>
<p>The structure of the entire fort is made with stone and lime mortar. The walls of the fort are not in a straight line, rather they are built-in zig zag with 4 gates for entry into the fort. Two gates were built parallel to each other, they are built in such a manner that the Sann River crosses diagonally both the gates. The river s along with the skirt of the gates making it difficult to be breached. The other two gates have multi-leveled doors that have floral ornamentation and carved stones on the walls. The main gate is well preserved and can be climbed to get a great view on both sides of the fort. The fort is said to be constructed in 1812 for 1.2 Million Rupees at that time in history. It is a very huge project that was completed at that time. It was the last capital of the Amirs of Sindh. The initial base of the fort had been laid down by Sindh Archeologists but there were renovations made in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century by the Talpur Mirs.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Visit Ranikot Fort:</strong></h2>
<p>The fort carried great importance in the history of the region and is the largest for the world, one should visit to see that how structures were constructed over such a huge land area back in the times. The carving of the stone has been recognized by different organizations among the best carvings of the world from historical times. The location of the fort is something that makes it more attractive as there is barren land on one side of the fort and we see an entire river flowing on the other side.</p>
<p>The architecture of the structure is unique and special in its way, with multi-layered doors, the semi-circular towers, and a fort within a fort. The reason for its construction is still unknown but it must have been home to a huge population and the architects who constructed this fort must have been very skilled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mental health indicates the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being of a person. It is all about how people feel and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to signify or imply the absence of mental disorders. Living with mental illness is one of the hardest things to do. It is a regular problem without any solution to it. There are treatments like medication and psychotherapy that are incredibly advantageous. Some of the most common self-help recommendations are to exercise, meditate, and be more present, these things seem to work for so many people. However, other proven methods to help fight mental health issues aren’t mentioned as often.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health issues</strong> can affect our daily lives, relationships, and physical health gravely. The most common mental health problems are anger issues, anxiety, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, depression, BPD, OCD, etc. To find the right coping mechanism you need to be patient as it takes time and effort, but it can highly impact how you feel. If you were unable to find successful techniques to help you fight mental illness by yourself, or maybe you want to add a few more to your list, here are a few coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals.</p>
<h2><strong>Accept Your Condition And Find Solution:</strong></h2>
<p>The first stage of curing any mental disorder is to accept the fact that your mental state is not sound or healthy, like any other disease. You cannot change the fact that you have a mental illness, so instead of trying to get rid of it or pretend that it doesn’t exist you need to accept that you have a problem and you need to find a solution to it. Ignoring these problems will only drain your energy. Accept yourself. Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to help yourself take care of it. Either you can go to a doctor or psychotherapist or you can help yourself by doing some exercise.</p>
<p>There are different types of methods for managing mental health problems. Treatment is highly individual, some strategies or treatments are more successful as compared to others. A person who has a chronic mental disorder may choose different treatments at different stages in their life. The individual needs to work meticulously with a doctor who can help them identify their problem and then provide them with suitable treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Early signs of Mental health issues:</strong></h2>
<p>There are so many visible signs of mental illness that anyone can notice as there is no physical test or scan that reliably indicates whether a person has developed a mental illness or not. We should look out for the following signs:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family</li>
<li>avoiding activities that you would normally enjoy</li>
<li>sleeping too much or too little</li>
<li>eating too much or too little</li>
<li>feeling hopeless</li>
<li>consistently low energy</li>
<li>using mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine, more frequently</li>
<li>displaying negative emotions</li>
<li>being confused</li>
<li>being unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or cooking a meal</li>
<li>having persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly</li>
<li>thinking of causing physical harm to themselves or those around them</li>
</ol>
<p>sometimes hearing voices and experiencing delusions</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Treatments:</strong></h2>
<p>There are various types of treatments that can help with mental illness, few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the type of treatment that takes a psychological approach to treat mental illness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy are some of the examples of psychotherapy. Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists are some of the doctors that carry out this type of treatment.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help people fathom the base of their mental illness and start to work on more wholesome thought patterns that help support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation, self-harm, and depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medication</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people who deal with strong mental health issues take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs. Although these medications cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve mental health and symptoms in general and help a person resume his/her social interaction and a normal routine while they work on the improvement of their mental health.</p>
<p>These medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of happy chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Some of these drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation from the brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-help</li>
</ul>
<p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to help themselves and make changes to their lifestyle to improve their condition. These changes might include reducing alcohol intake, improving their sleep cycle, and eating a balanced, healthy diet. Self-help also includes taking out time from work to resolve personal issues that may be causing great damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>People with conditions such as anxiety or depression may benefit from relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness. Having a support system of friends and family can also help a lot in improving one&#8217;s mental state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dancing House or also known as Fred and Ginger is in the city of Prague in the Czech Republic, it is the building for the national Netherland in the region. The building has been designed by two architects from different regions: Vlado Milunic from Croatia-Czech and the other was an American Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The design of the building is so different and unique that one is not able to understand whether to praise or criticize it. The building was designed in 1992 and it took four years to complete the construction. Prague is famous for building designs related too gothic, baroque, and even Nouveau. Even though there was a lot of criticism from the entire region but the people living close to this construction site were in favor of it, hoping that one day it will become a culturally important building enhancing the activities of the region. The name that was initially given to the building was Fred and Ginger based on two famous American dancers but the idea was dropped as it may offend the local people of the region for not boosting the local talent or stars.</p>
<h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1899 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004.jpg" alt="History" width="623" height="413" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-300x199.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-370x245.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-400x265.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image004-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The location of the dancing house carries great importance as it was built on the area where a house was destroyed by the US bombing in Prague during 1945. Around 15 years the damaged property was not given importance and then a famous architect presented the idea to the semi owner of the land that what he had in mind. He was a neighbor to this land area as well, and he came into some power in the later years. His influence and connections helped the architect give shape to his ideas with all the support. This man was little known as Václav Havel. He was a well-known leader and later became the president of Czechoslovakia. Due to the history of the land the Dutch insurance company had agreed to sponsor the funding required for the building. The sponsorship required teaming up with a famous architect from another region, a few architects declined the offer as the land area was very small, but the American Canadian Architect took up the challenge.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure of the Dancing House:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1900" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006.jpg" alt="Structure of the Dancing House" width="623" height="776" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-241x300.jpg 241w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-370x461.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-185x230.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-20x25.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-400x498.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image006-39x48.jpg 39w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The dancing house is structured in a very nontraditional method known as deconstructivist, the shape of the building is very unusual, and the dancing shape of the building is supported by 99 concrete panels. Each of the concrete panels had to be designed in a unique and specific way with different shapes and dimensions. The top of the building is made of twisted metal known as Mary. In the middle of all the square and rectangle buildings, this odd building had two major parts. Curved pillars that had been placed to support the glass towers, the second is what runs parallel to the river with unique moldings and widows that are not aligned with each other.</p>
<p>A tower made of rock is used to represent one of the dancers and there is a metalhead that is also placed on top of it. The second dancer is represented through the glass tower. An attempt to make a three-dimensional effect had been made by architects, the windows had been placed in such a way that it is difficult to understand how many floors are there and in a way that it should look very different and unique from the building around it. The building is based on 9 floors where two floors are underground.</p>
<h2><strong>Interior of the Dancing house:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008.jpg" alt="Interior of the Dancing house" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008.jpg 624w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-300x169.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-370x208.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-185x104.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-400x225.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image008-85x48.jpg 85w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>The exterior and the interior have been done by different architects, the interior was mostly done by a British architect, Eva Jiřičná. Due to the unusual and irregular shape of the building, the internal structure of the rooms was very asymmetric as well. The lobby and the first floor had been designed for commercial purposes, six of the floors for office spaces, and the top floor for a restaurant. The top was meant to be the restaurant due to the view from the windows. The building is uniquely designed like the internal of a ship with narrow hallways to make more space for the offices, as the building is very narrow due to the structure.</p>
<h2><strong>The Dancing House Today:</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1902" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009.jpg" alt="The Dancing House Today" width="1135" height="757" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009.jpg 1135w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-800x534.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-740x494.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image009-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1135px) 100vw, 1135px" /></p>
<p>As of today, the dancing house has been renovated to a 21-room luxury hotel with the restaurant on the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. The restaurant is named after Fred and ginger, the dancers. There is a bar on the 8<sup>th</sup> floor which is made entirely on the glass. The building exterior and interior are considered a piece of art and now the building even has an art gallery in the building.</p>
<p>The Dancing house has been honored with its feature on a 2,000 Czech Koruna coin issued by the national bank. The design of the dancing house has won the design contest by Times Magazine in 1997 and is known as one of the five most important buildings by the architectural community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of people who have worked in the architecture industry around the globe while only a few have been able to make a mark in the industry and are known for their work. Some of the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/a-tribute-to-the-pakistani-architect-yasmeen-lari/">famous architects</a> have attended formal architecture education while some have not, but they have achieved such a reputation with their work that they make the formal education un-necessary. <strong>Antoni Gaudi</strong> is known as a gem in the architecture industry and was known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernism. He belonged to the region of Spain and there is no evidence regarding any formal education that he had acquired to work in the domain of Architecture. Gaudi&#8217;s work is individualized and does not take influence from the work completed by anyone else, his work is one of a kind and unique. Most of his work has been completed in the city of Barcelona, Spain. The greatest work of his life is also located in Barcelona that is the Church of the Sagrada Familia.</p>
<h2><strong>Antoni Gaudi and Modernista Movement:</strong></h2>
<p>Antoine Gaudi had a unique way of working and took all the influence from his passions of the architect, religious beliefs, and nature for his work. He considered every aspect of the work that he wanted to complete and have them implemented properly in all categories such as glasswork, ceramics, ironwork, and even woodwork. He was very thoughtful about the environment as well and had introduced new techniques that helped in the treatment of materials such as trencadis, which was used to treat or utilize the broken/waste ceramic pieces. The work of Gaudi was more inclined towards the Neo-Gothic art and techniques of the oriental side. There was a Modernista Movement which was gaining popularity by the start of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and Gaudi became an active part of the movement. Being a part of this movement, his work depicted modernism, which exhibited his work to be in an organic form relatable to natural forms.  As he did not have formal education, so Gaudi rarely made diagrams or plan sheets for his work, he rather made 3 dimensions of scale modeling and modeled all the details onto it as per his perception.</p>
<h2>Antoni Gaudi’s Work<strong>:</strong></h2>
<p>Gaudi has been admired and studied by the new architects since he gained all the popularity of his work. His masterpiece is one of the best creations in the world of architecture even though it is incomplete, the Saragada Familia Church. This church is the most visited monument in the entire region of Spain. After 70 of his death, seven of his projects had been declared as heritage sites by UNESCO, so that the structures are not modified or harmed. His work exhibited his religious following of the Roman Catholic faith that was visible in most. For this specific reason he was named or widely called God&#8217;s Architect, and this further made him work in the same direction.</p>

<p>The Church is a marvelous site for any person who has the eye of seeing the beauty in any structure, it is an ornate mix of Baroque, Gothic, Moorish and Victorian elements that have been depicted on ornamental tilework. The shapes that build up the entire structure are influenced by nature specifically trees, tree-like columns have been used to hold the interior of the entire church. His way of structuring the church has influenced many buildings around the globe and will keep on doing so in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Other Famous Projects<strong>:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Casa Milla</strong> is an apartment block that has been made by taking the influence of multipeaked mountains and is based in Montserrat. The apartment block looks like a mountain from far away and has been planned very beautifully depicting the idea taken from God himself as it resembles the mountains created by Him.</p>
<p><strong>Park Guell</strong> is another of his famous works which are inspired by the Roman temples and a forest has been well created by this marvel of Gaudi. It is a park system that consists of different gardens that have been planned around an architectural building. The colors used in the tiles are like that of the flowers that one cannot get their eyes off from.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1894" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1.jpg" alt="Park Guell" width="576" height="864" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1.jpg 576w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-370x555.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-185x278.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-20x30.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-400x600.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image008-1-32x48.jpg 32w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p><strong>Palau Guell</strong> is a mansion that has been designed by the architect Antoni Gaudi for an industrial tycoon. It is one of the initial commission work that he indulged in. The ironwork outside the building has been done in iron and it resembles seaweed, there were separate areas to enter for the guests, the animals for carriage and even the servants so that nothing got mixed up. The major attraction is the main living room which had small holes in the high rood ceiling that was used to hang lanterns, this made it look like a starlit sky in the night. His work carries great value in the industry today and is studied all around the globe by architecture professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you becoming increasingly frustrated with the unpredictability of life these days? Are you sick of hearing about the coronavirus? Tired of being stuck at home with difficult people? Are the current world events bringing you down and affecting your mental health? Do you find yourself in a downward spiral with no end in sight? Are you having extremely conflicting feelings regarding the lockdown being lifted?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any of these, I want you to know you are not alone. Many of us are feeling overwhelmed with the current situation and it feels like there is no end in sight and while we can&#8217;t control the virus what we can control is our response to it. Many of us might be waiting for the situation to fix itself rather than finding ways to acclimate to our surroundings. If you’re feeling out of control then its time to switch your focus from things you cannot control to things you can control; and the only thing we have any control over is ourselves and how we choose to react and respond. Below are some tried and tested ways to address your feelings in a way that is helpful to you and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set some boundaries for yourself.</strong> One thing that can be extremely helpful is asking friends and families to stop sending coronavirus updates. Such messages can be triggering and can really affect our mental health because it consumes our thoughts and feelings. Another useful tip is to stop watching the news. Let go of your need to constantly know what’s happening, instead set a boundary for yourself in terms of how much information you receive. Make a commitment to yourself to get only one update per day and save yourself from the overload of negative information out there.</li>
<li><strong>Make small but helpful adjustments to your daily routine. </strong>Adding a morning mantra to your routine can be extremely helpful as it sets the tone for the day. A very popular mantra used for many years is:</li>
</ul>
<p>God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change</p>
<p>The courage to change things I can and the</p>
<p>Wisdom to know the difference</p>
<p>A daily “check-in” with yourself is also another way to understand your feelings better. Simply ask yourself the following questions: How do I feel at this moment? How is my body reacting to the environment? Where in my body am I carry my emotions? Do I have more negative thoughts or positive ones? Again knowing how you feel first thing in the morning will also help set the tone for the day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand unwanted thoughts and feelings. </strong>While checking in with yourself you may find you have a lot of unwanted thoughts or feelings. One of the easiest and quickest ways to counter these thoughts is to fact check them. Ask yourself how realistic these thoughts and feelings are? Are they in sync with your surroundings? Many times we find our mind has been playing tricks on us by making us believe what we are feeling is real, which of course it is. But the question to ask yourself is “is this feeling valid?” and more often then not you will find your thoughts and emotions are irrelevant to the situation. If they are not, go back to the above mantra and identify between what you can control and what you cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Create a support system. </strong>Asking for help from others can be very nerve-wracking, but knowing you are not alone in your fears and anxiety is an antidote itself. When we realize there are others who feel similar to us it gives a sense of belonging and understanding. Sometimes the support system you create for yourself consists of friends and family, other times it could be a support group or a therapist. Whatever is your comfort zone identify it and remember to access it in times of need.</li>
<li><strong>Breathe!</strong> <strong>It will be okay! </strong>I know this lockdown has really changed our lifestyle and many of us might have trouble adjusting to it and that’s totally okay! Take your time, experiment and find out what’s right for you, what works and what doesn’t and slowly but surely you will find stability in the midst of chaos.</li>
</ul>

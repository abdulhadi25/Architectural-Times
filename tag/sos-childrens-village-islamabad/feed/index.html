<h2>Dynamism behind Conquest of SOS Children’s Village</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1580" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007.jpg" alt="Dynamism behind Conquest of SOS Children’s Village" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007.jpg 1920w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-800x533.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-740x493.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1110x740.jpg 1110w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image007-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>To chase their motive, they are striving hard to polish their character, personality, abilities and, manners. The school is endeavoring to provide them a normal and secure life that was taken from them by the horrible earthquake of 2005. The efforts of SOS Children’s Village are visible and the enthusiasm is enormous. One of the most remarkable and appreciating contributions of the school is providing them a family environment. It all is just because of their revolutionary objectives, dedication, and keenness. Thence, students do not feel lonesome rather more secured and protected. Consequently, they feel and enjoy a sense of belonging which is truly important for their personality building. Howbeit, the children learn moral values, share responsibilities and form life-long relationships. Since the family environment provides them a compacted and concrete foundation on which they can establish their lives.</p>
<h2>A Lucrative Corporation</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1581" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009.png" alt="A Lucrative Corporation" width="820" height="312" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009.png 820w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-300x114.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-768x292.png 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-370x141.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-800x304.png 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-185x70.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-740x282.png 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-20x8.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-400x152.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image009-126x48.png 126w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p>Working for the welfare of children, the institute is also paying heed to their moral development of character and personality.  This is truly a humane endeavor to give veracious direction to their instincts. The focal aim of SOS Children’s Village is to assist them in becoming morally and ethically virtuous individuals. For that, the management of the SOS Children’s Village is direly pinpointing their religious upbringing. Religious edification is an integral component of the school. In addition to this, Extra-curricular activities are also devised which includes sports and musical events, scouts and girl guides, games, cooking and art classes. These extra-curricular activities exert as a positive reinforcement to the children who have taken a bumpy ride in the bygone days. Children are also sporadically taken to trips as well. Since some of the children have gone through miserable and tough times, or come from neglected and sometimes ferocious circumstances, the facility of psychological counseling is also offered to resolve their mental issues. Verily, the SOS Children’s Village is an endorsement of triumph.</p>
<h2> A Pledge of Magnanimous Outlook</h2>

<p>Notable that the organization is not just providing them shelter but also taking care of their basic needs. The school has taken the accountability of their secured future and notably fulfilling each and every commitment. Children are shielded from moral exploitation or any sort of abusing conduct and are kept safe during in any circumstances. Howsoever, all the primary and secondary needs of children are sought to be satisfied with their sound development.</p>

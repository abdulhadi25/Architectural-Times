<p>It’s heartwarming to see the awareness being raised around the topic of <strong>mental health</strong>. While our efforts are not going to waste there is still so much left to do to really eliminate the stigma associated with mental health and help-seeking behavior.  </p>



<p>Most articles I’ve come across in recent times focus on highlighting the importance of mental health. The articles will share some statistics or will explain what is mental health and how we should be paying more attention to it. None of the writers talk about what it&#8217;s like dealing with some suffering from a mental illness or dealing with mental illness themselves. None of the articles focus on educating the reader about the resources available, or what can be done to eradicate the stigma. It&#8217;s like we have been made aware of the problem but we are not given a solution.</p>



<p>I recognize that it is important to share information about mental health in order to create awareness. I believe it is equally important to talk about how we as a society can work together to help those struggling with mental illnesses. It is also important to talk about how families, friends and peer groups can help a person recover and sustain a healthy lifestyle. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists all are great resources to access if you are brave enough to put yourself out there, but typically people are not comfortable seeking help because families are disapproving, society is judgmental and friends are unsupportive.</p>



<p>So what can we do as a society to help these individuals feel comfortable in their own skin? Well, the answer is simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>We can <em>listen </em>to them without judgment and try to understand what’s going on in their head. Don’t offer them advice or solutions, it only makes them feel inadequate as if they don’t know what’s best for them.</li>
<li><em>Support</em> them by not undermining their feelings instead of validating them.</li>
<li>Accept their reality. Even if we don’t agree with what they are feeling or we don’t understand what they are going through is irrelevant, people struggling with mental health disorders just want someone to be there for them.</li>
<li> Practice empathy and not sympathy. Here’s how I see it when you sympathize with someone you are just saying the words, “that sucks” “I’m sorry” “poor you” etc. it requires little emotional support on our part, it’s a quick attempt to make the person feel better without really taking an interest in what’s bothering them. Empathy requires us to be emotionally involved in a person’s problem by making their problem our problem and working together towards a solution. So an easy way to remember the difference between sympathy and empathy is the first letter of the word S and E saying and engaging.</li>
<li>Be <em>kind. </em>Talking to someone who is struggling can be difficult but it’s important to remember that a few kind words can mean the world to someone dealing with a mental illness. Your patience will help heal then, and your kindness can ease their anxiety. It doesn’t take much to be kind.   </li>
</ul>

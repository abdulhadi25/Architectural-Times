<p><strong>    Make Spaces seem Detached:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1659" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6.jpg" alt="Budget Friendly Home decor" width="1280" height="935" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6.jpg 1280w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-300x219.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-768x561.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-370x270.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-800x584.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-185x135.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-740x541.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-1110x811.jpg 1110w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-400x292.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image003-6-66x48.jpg 66w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>At times, a mammoth, open room seems<em> extra</em> commodious. For instance, one giant room can function as the kitchen, living room, and dining room so it becomes vague where one space leaves off and the subsequent initiates. Thence, through paint, you can give its own identity to each place.</p>
<p><strong>    Application of Streaks</strong>:</p>
<p>The most common and easy to apply by just taping off segments of the wall and painting between the outlines. It can be either horizontal or vertical streaks.</p>
<p><strong>    Tender of Stenciling:</strong></p>
<p>It is an absolutely effective and easiest way to renovate the <strong>home decor</strong> of your home. You can purchase prêt-à-porter stencils or create your own from taut cardboard. What you need is to trace the chosen pattern onto the cardboard and scratch it out. After that hold the stencil up against the wall and paint over it. Using a stencil is an operative way to get the look of patterned wallpaper for less money.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Rearrange the Furniture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Rearranging the setting of your furniture is also effective and budget-friendly to give a new look to your home. The shuffling of the furnishers and trundling of other adorning objects can repudiate the monotony. Rearrangement of the furniture is the most useful remedy to renovate your home without spending a single penny. You can also exchange the furniture for one room with the other room. You can shuffle the vase, couches and other decorating material of rooms with each other. And, the incredibly best part of it is that it costs absolutely nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shop Secondhand </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Shopping from secondhand vendors is also budget-friendly and common practice to reform the look of your place. We have a variety of vendors to find secondhand furniture which is in a good position to have it at our home. For that, we can approach to reuse centers, thrift stores, <strong>craigslist, free cycle retail areas, etc.</strong> These all are helpful in finding budget-friendly furniture, <strong>home decor</strong> accessories, appliances, and oodles of other home-revamping materials for a fraction of actual cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amalgamation of Old and New Furniture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have already failed in searching the coveted furniture at a low cost, don’t haste to give up. Sometimes you can easily make what you want by transforming an old piece to new perseverance. An amalgamation of old and new furniture can result in exceptionally glowing and provide you some modish and voguish outcomes. You can easily use your old furniture and transform it into new and chic stuff by just spending a few pennies on its transformation or you can do it on your own as well.  For instance, you can transform Dresser drawers to a bookcase, dresser to shelving, bookcase to a bar, dresser to a sink vanity, etc</p>

<p>With the start of a new decade, minimalism is out and maximalism is in. While minimalism emphases on harmonizing things down and creating it docile and forthright. Contrary to this, maximalism designing is the whole opposite. Maximalism is about embracing the grandeur and magnificence without any accumulation of big, bold, bright colors and patterns, gaudy decor and colorful abstract paintings. Hence, maximalism designing has triumphantly become one of the topmost trends of 2020.</p>

So many of us invest in grand and expensive home decor items to make our homes look beautiful, presentable and aesthetically pleasing. If there’s home decor item that’s all of that and dare I say, affordable, it’s the simple and classy spell-work of flowers.</p>

<p>Flowers are one of the most beautiful forms of home decor. The variety one finds when it comes to flowers is inexhaustible. They effortlessly fit into any room of the house, be it the bedroom, the kitchen or even the bathrooms. Better yet, they have the ability to uplift other decorations, blank walls and even entire rooms.</p>
<p>One can pair them up with numerable different kinds of vases based on budget as well as the character of the room. They can be paired up with the traditional yet classy crystal vases that sit well mostly in drawing rooms and dining rooms. For the living room or kitchen, you can go for a little more chic and trendy options like mason jars, ceramic vases and even aluminium or stainless steel vases.</p>

<p>Flowers are a great way of adding an aromatic experience to your home. While they’re a treat for the eyes, some plants and flowers also purify the air in the home by taking in and eliminating harmful toxins and unpleasant odors. One can choose to place them right at the entrance of the house to make it a delightful experience for any guest who enters or make them a centerpiece in your living room to add a bit of a natural and refreshing aroma.</p>
<p>Some of the ideal spots for flower arrangements are home entrances, living rooms and bedrooms. Flowers at the entrance are a great way to be greeted as you come home from long and hard day’s work. Moreover, as guests enter, they’re welcomed by colour, charm and warmth. A floral arrangement can completely convert the look of a living room. Depending on the layout of the room, you can place a small yet ritzy arrangement on the coffee table or right next to the window where the sunshine falls directly on the flowers and creates a magical visual.</p>

<p>As lovely as it is when someone gets you flowers, it’s so much more elevating to get flowers for yourself. Bedroom drawers are one of the best spots for floral arrangements. Bedrooms are safe havens. Its where most of us unwind, relax and reenergize ourselves, and what could possibly be better to have right next to your bed if not flowers? They’re soothing to look at right before you fall asleep and they feel like a breath of fresh air when you wake up.</p>
<p>Flowers are a great way to compliment certain color schemes in homes and bring plain walls to life. Blank white or painted walls are one of the best backdrops for a beautiful and grandiose flower arrangement. With the minimalist trend going, hoarding countless decor pieces to make your home look elegant and classy is anachronistic and passe. Flowers offer all of that and the cherry on top is that they’re budget friendly.</p>

<p>In other cultures, for example, the Japanese consider the art of flower arrangement as meaningful and symbolic. Ikebana is the ancient Japanese art of flower arranging that sees branches, flowers and leaves set at different angles to represent ten (heaven), chi (earth) and jin (man). Most florists in Japan use this arranging technique to promote minimalist art and harmony. How beautiful is that?</p>

<p>While not all flowers are available in every season and for those who want to maintain their wall art and décor, dried and faux flowers are terrific alternatives. Faux flowers also work well for those who have pollen allergies but cannot stay away from these beauties of nature. Looking back into the past, faux flowers were considered tacky and cheap. But if there is one flower trend that everyone needs to follow; it’s faux flowers! They’ve made a huge comeback and for all the right reasons. Today, you can find beautifully handmade faux flowers that look like they’ve just been picked out of the garden. The ones that are better in quality are made from silk and look anything but plastic. They may be a little expensive than real flowers, but, it’s an investment that you’ll be thankful for later. They’re convenient, long-lasting and incredibly efficient.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram has made it easier to promote your budding café or restaurant without having to spend thousands on advertising. One can showcase the best possible version in a photograph, add relevant hashtags and with a single tap on their phones, they’ve instantly reach millions of people. Is it possible for people to taste your food by looking at the picture that appeared in their feed? No. But what they can see is, how it is presented and in what setting it is presented in. The ambience and essence of the place can be captured, allowing viewers to decide whether it is the ideal place for them to share a meal with their friends, family or co-workers. With the concept of eateries, now being as the ultimate go to hangout place, retailers would want to stand out to their customers by providing more than just delicious food. Playing with the ambience and altering it for the comfort of their target audience, it can be ensured that they have a good experience overall, making them want to revisit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-1512 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004.jpg" alt="Is it only the food served that matters?" width="310" height="202" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004.jpg 310w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004-300x195.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004-185x121.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image004-74x48.jpg 74w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></p>
<p>Aiming for a modern and attractive interior can easily overshadow just how essential the layout of a café or restaurant is to the success of the design. If it fails, the entire functioning of the café will collapse. It is very necessary to carefully study the ergonomics required for your specific serving style, whether it will be fine dining, casual dining, fast food place or a bistro. It will dictate if serving staff is required or will self-service cater better to your needs. These decisions seemingly small are what your entire seating arrangement is based on. If the server does not have enough space to pass through the aisle or customers cannot back up their chairs without bumping into the person behind them, no matter how attractive or cozy your interior is, it will result in an unpleasant experience. On the contrary, leaving way too much space around, also has a negative effect. It will be a waste of space and make the eatery always appear to be empty, even when it is busy with customers.</p>

<p>The furniture chosen should strictly follow the rules of ergonomics. Have you ever been to a restaurant where the table was so far that you had to sit on the edge of your seat through the entirety of the meal or your chair was too low compared to the table that it was causing a strain on your arms, or worse, your chair didn’t have a back rest at all? People looking for a pleasant dinging experience, should be able to enjoy their meal without having to worry about straining their back and arms.</p>
<p>Once, the layout and furniture is sorted, fulfilling the functional needs, the focus can entirely be shifted towards making your interior aesthetically pleasing for the customers. Light holds the power to set the mood of the space. It can make it appear dramatic, cozy, warm or just bright depending on the ambience you’re going for. To make it easier to decide on the type of lighting required, one needs to understand what purpose that certain light fixture will serve; Will it be used to generally illuminate the dining area or will it be in place to compliment the overall theme by functioning as a decorative element or whether it is needed to create emphasis on certain elements of the interior designed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1524 size-large" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-819x1024.jpg" alt="best furniture design for cafe" width="819" height="1024" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-240x300.jpg 240w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-768x960.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-370x463.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-185x231.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-740x925.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-20x25.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-400x500.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image012-38x48.jpg 38w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></p>
<p>The perfect blend of natural and artificial light usually does the trick. A space washed by natural light makes it appear open and has a positive effect on the diner’s mood. Along with it, incorporating green elements in your design, by capturing a view of the landscaping around the venue or placing indoor plants can liven up your space, make it visually pleasing and be a source of comfort for the customers. If possible a small area of the restaurant should be dedicated to an outdoor setting. If the weather is pleasant, people will always prefer a place where they can enjoy good food and good weather without having to be locked inside a room, since, it takes away from the charm of the weather. It will also serve as a design element inviting customers to your restaurant when they walk by it.</p>

<p>As much as light is important, so is the theme of your café which is closely knit with the materials used and the color palette that is followed. It is the reflection of the type of food you serve and decides the age group you’re mainly trying to attract. For example, A dynamic design, including elements such as graffiti, neon props, accent lighting and a bright color palette, hints at a younger age group and will be loud and overwhelming for a family looking for a peaceful place to dine at. On the contrary, use of earthy tones and colors such as grey and white, can serve as a neutral color palette as it doesn’t define a specific age group and welcomes people with varying interests. Colors like red and yellow instantly pop into one’s mind when thinking about a restaurant due to their psychological effect of increasing appetite but it can be hard to incorporate such bright colors in your design while avoiding the discomfort they can cause when not curated properly. Using such colors in a subtle manner, using varying hues, shades and tones, for feature wall, props and furniture, can result in a successful design.</p>

<a href='https://architecturaltimes.news/is-it-only-the-food-served-that-matters/image018/'><img width="403" height="425" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="attachment-full size-full thb-lazyload lazyload" alt="Is it only the food served that matters?" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" data-src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018.jpg 403w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-284x300.jpg 284w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-370x390.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-20x21.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-185x195.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-400x422.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image018-46x48.jpg 46w" /></a>

<p>Textures and materials must also be considered simultaneously when deciding on colors, since, they reinforce the essence one is aiming for. A warm and cozy interior can be taken one step forward by using bare brick or wooden textures where possible. Similarly, metal can be used in eateries that wish to give off a more modern vibe, by combining it with a color palette comprising of greys and white.</p>
<p>It is very easy to get carried away and overdo the interior décor, as you aim for the customers to fully grasp and understand your theme, as soon as they walk in. In wanting for them to understand the intended atmosphere, one might end up using excessive relevant props or make the space appear either too bright or too dull, making it difficult for the customers to stay there for long, let alone consider to revisit. If functionality is kept in mind and a fine line is drawn between minimal and overdone, your eatery will definitely be a success in your community and a hit on Instagram, but don’t forget to make sure that your food still outweighs the aesthetic interior!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1240" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights.jpg" alt="panos lighting Architectural Times Magazine" width="600" height="603" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights.jpg 600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-150x150.jpg 150w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-180x180.jpg 180w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-90x90.jpg 90w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-450x452.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-270x270.jpg 270w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-20x20.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-225x226.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Bohemian and organic, each one of the Tiffany Chandeliers is handcrafted with meticulousness with its breathtaking stained glass mosaic style.</p>



<p>Each lamp is a collectible item with high durability and colors that never fade. If the colors look a little dull due to exposure to pollution, a little bit of oil on a soft cloth will bring back the chandelier’s vivacity. It would look great with antique or classical furniture as well as modern both.</p>



<h2><strong>3. </strong>LED Lights</h2>

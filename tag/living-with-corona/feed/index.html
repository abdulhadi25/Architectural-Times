										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you becoming increasingly frustrated with the unpredictability of life these days? Are you sick of hearing about the coronavirus? Tired of being stuck at home with difficult people? Are the current world events bringing you down and affecting your mental health? Do you find yourself in a downward spiral with no end in sight? Are you having extremely conflicting feelings regarding the lockdown being lifted?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any of these, I want you to know you are not alone. Many of us are feeling overwhelmed with the current situation and it feels like there is no end in sight and while we can&#8217;t control the virus what we can control is our response to it. Many of us might be waiting for the situation to fix itself rather than finding ways to acclimate to our surroundings. If you’re feeling out of control then its time to switch your focus from things you cannot control to things you can control; and the only thing we have any control over is ourselves and how we choose to react and respond. Below are some tried and tested ways to address your feelings in a way that is helpful to you and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set some boundaries for yourself.</strong> One thing that can be extremely helpful is asking friends and families to stop sending coronavirus updates. Such messages can be triggering and can really affect our mental health because it consumes our thoughts and feelings. Another useful tip is to stop watching the news. Let go of your need to constantly know what’s happening, instead set a boundary for yourself in terms of how much information you receive. Make a commitment to yourself to get only one update per day and save yourself from the overload of negative information out there.</li>
<li><strong>Make small but helpful adjustments to your daily routine. </strong>Adding a morning mantra to your routine can be extremely helpful as it sets the tone for the day. A very popular mantra used for many years is:</li>
</ul>
<p>God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change</p>
<p>The courage to change things I can and the</p>
<p>Wisdom to know the difference</p>
<p>A daily “check-in” with yourself is also another way to understand your feelings better. Simply ask yourself the following questions: How do I feel at this moment? How is my body reacting to the environment? Where in my body am I carry my emotions? Do I have more negative thoughts or positive ones? Again knowing how you feel first thing in the morning will also help set the tone for the day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand unwanted thoughts and feelings. </strong>While checking in with yourself you may find you have a lot of unwanted thoughts or feelings. One of the easiest and quickest ways to counter these thoughts is to fact check them. Ask yourself how realistic these thoughts and feelings are? Are they in sync with your surroundings? Many times we find our mind has been playing tricks on us by making us believe what we are feeling is real, which of course it is. But the question to ask yourself is “is this feeling valid?” and more often then not you will find your thoughts and emotions are irrelevant to the situation. If they are not, go back to the above mantra and identify between what you can control and what you cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Create a support system. </strong>Asking for help from others can be very nerve-wracking, but knowing you are not alone in your fears and anxiety is an antidote itself. When we realize there are others who feel similar to us it gives a sense of belonging and understanding. Sometimes the support system you create for yourself consists of friends and family, other times it could be a support group or a therapist. Whatever is your comfort zone identify it and remember to access it in times of need.</li>
<li><strong>Breathe!</strong> <strong>It will be okay! </strong>I know this lockdown has really changed our lifestyle and many of us might have trouble adjusting to it and that’s totally okay! Take your time, experiment and find out what’s right for you, what works and what doesn’t and slowly but surely you will find stability in the midst of chaos.</li>
</ul>

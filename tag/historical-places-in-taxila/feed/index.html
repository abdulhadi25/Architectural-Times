										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adjacent to the federal city, there is an antique destination, Taxila, known for its relics and remnants of an ancient civilization. Taxila, for thousands of years, relished massive admiration as the epicenter of art, education, architecture, and sculpture in Buddhism. Taxila is home to thousands of ancient sites, historical sacred places, Buddhist Sculptures, earth-shattering specimens of architecture, and many archaeological sites. Thence, Taxila is essentially a gateway to explore archeological wonders, a number of specimens of art and sacred places. One of them is the <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong>, one of the vital specimens of architecture, which exhibits the ancient ruins of civilization. It is pretty scarce to acknowledge that the <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong> appears to have been a sacred place of Zoroastrian in the heart of Buddhist Civilization.</p>
<h2>Essential Clue of Ancient Civilization</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1586" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002.jpg 640w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image002-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Contiguous to Taxila, there situates an ancient Temple named <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong> which is an exclusive destination for the adorers and seekers of history. The Jandial Temple Taxila is a historical consecrated place, located near Taxila. This historic temple is predominately exhibiting the ancient ruins of the ancient Civilization of Greeks. Verily, the Jandial temple is an integral prodigy of Greek Civilization show-casing the architecture designs of the ancient time. Thence, it is home to a wide range of staggering relics and the ancient ruins of the Greek architecture and Zoroastrian religious rituals. The mingling of two distinctive entities amplifies the fame of <strong>Jandial Temple Taxila</strong>.</p>
<h2>Jandial Temple Taxila; A Momentous Specimen of Architecture</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1587" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2.jpg 600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-370x278.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-20x15.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-185x139.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-400x300.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image003-2-64x48.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The temple is certainly anticipated as a Zoroastrian temple. The structure of the temple is replicated from the paradigm of the temples of classical Greece. The Janidal temple is set up on a synthetic embankment which greatly resembles the classical temples of Greece. The semblance of the Jandial temple to the ancient Greek temples is prominently arresting. The structure of the temple consists of a central shrine with four lonic columns supporting a porch. The foremost shrine is rectangular in plan whereas the wall is solid masonry with perforated window openings which peculiarly intensifies the spell of its architecture.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable features of this consecrated site is the architecture and arrangement of the range of shrines and lonic columns within it. Per contra, the eccentric architecture of the Jandial Temple Taxila is one of the reasons for its peculiarity even after so long. For that, it is measured as one of the unique specimens of the architecture. Verily, the temple is also ominously feted as a <em>Semi-Classical </em>temple. Howbeit, the design of the temple is essentially taken from the Greek Architecture of temples, with the segregation of inner and frontier chambers. In the present temple, the frontier chamber is replaced by two lonic columns which are framed by the two antae (specific posts or pillars on either side of the doorway of Greek temples) walls.</p>
<h2>Jandial Temple Taxila Antique Profundity</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1588" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004.jpg" alt="Jandial Temple Taxila Antique Profundity" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-768x512.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-370x247.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-800x534.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-740x494.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-400x267.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image004-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The structure of the Jandial temple is unique in Punjab due to its Greek quintessence and is taken as an altar. Historically, the Jandial Temple is one of the hallmarks of antique historical architecture which was constructed in the lonic edict. Since there is no exact alignment regarding the period of its constructions. However, it is assumed that the construction of the temple was initiated in the <strong>1st century</strong> BC. Hither to, Jandial Temple Taxila was traced and reconstructed by Indo Greek Kings Demetrius and Menander in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Zoroastrian Temple in the Core of Buddhist Civilization</h2>
<p>Taxila is considered a cradle of Buddhist Civilization replete with its relics and ruins. However, there is oddly situated a Zoroastrian temple in the core of Buddhist Civilization. Consequently, the Jandial temple is getting popularity and becoming a public-eye for the seekers of an ancient civilization. Indeed, the Jandial temple is a paragon of remarkable freakishness.</p>

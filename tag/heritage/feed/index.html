<p>Swat is today known as ‘Mini Switzerland of Pakistan’, after the boom in the tourism industry. It has a lot of scenics and natural landscapes to offer to those who decide to witness them in person. The lush green valley provides a retreat space in its mountains, snowcapped peaks, and crystal clear lakes. The hospitable nature of the residents, combined with the picturesque landscapes makes it a top travel destination, for not only Pakistanis but also foreigners touring the Northern Areas of Pakistan. What most people miss during their travels is that Swat has much more to offer than just scenic views, cool climate, and peace. The city has hundreds of years of heritage, as it was home to the Gandhara Civilization. Multiple carvings, Stupas, and Buddha statues are spread around the city, making it an attraction for Buddhists as well.</p>

<p>When we walk the trails in Swat, with clear streams on one side, followed by blossoming peach trees and scenic Mountain View on the other side, we must remember the people who have walked the same path before us, the civilizations who had once lived here. As you are walking up the trail towards the Amluk Dara Stupa, you can witness it in all its glory. The mountains in the distance serve as the perfect backdrop for this historic site. The tall stupa appears to be the perfect element to complete the scenic view. Walking around the Stupa, touching the stone from hundreds of years earlier instantly connects you to the past. You can visualize the life that was once present here and wonders what an average day in their life was like. Navigating through the ruins brings a sensation of being a part of a scene that is much older than you.</p>

<p>As you steer through the streets of Mingora, you find yourself surrounded by market places that seem to be placed very randomly and built wherever land was found, but that perspective soon changes when you look in the distance and find houses propped up on the mountains with high stairways leading up to them. You now look at it as a piece of art. It is all framed perfectly when you stand atop a mountain and look down at the city, and see their tall stairways, busy streets, and small houses. It all seems to blend in together, complimenting each other’s existence.</p>

<p>One cannot really say that they have visited Swat if they haven’t interacted with the rich culture and history it has to offer. The landscapes when seen in reference to the city’s architecture and archaeological site sets the tone and gives you a hint of where this city came from.</p>



<p> In order to truly appreciate the present, it is necessary to build a connection with the past. The people of Swat have realized this and made continuous efforts to ensure that the city presents itself in all its glory- past and present, to the visitors. In the age of travel blogging and tourism, generally, being on a rise, we should build long-lasting connections with places that we visit. Observing the present scenery against the manifestations of the past does just that for the tourist so that when they return to their homes, they truly feel connected to the city of Swat, a city that is now more than just landscapes to you.</p>

<p><strong>Kayal</strong>, a hidden secret of Islamabad, is a retail store situated in the busy and bustling Beverley Center. Skirted amongst the hippest restaurants and cafes and overlooking the green and serene Margalla hills, it stands as the pinnacle of art and charm.</p>
<h2 style="color: #4e4e4e;">Kayal where quirky meets culture.</h2>



<p><strong>Kayal</strong> strives to bring together artists and small businesses from all over Pakistan and provide them with a platform to showcase their handcrafted goods. The store’s aim is to offer locally made products that are trendy, high in quality and a celebration of our rich cultural heritage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="676" class="wp-image-1107" src="http://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2.jpg 750w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-300x270.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-450x406.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-225x203.jpg 225w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-20x18.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Kayal</strong> exhibits products from more than twenty different businesses offering a diverse variety that ranges from home décor, skincare, jewelry, apparel, and stationary. <strong>Kayal</strong> has also launched its own line of clothing that includes summery kurtas, floral dresses and chic lowers. One can spot ceramic art, hand-poured candles, bahawalpuri style jhumkay, hand painted coasters and trays and much more. Pakistan inspired products like cushions, tables, paintings and scarves also seem to dominate the trend of the shop. The slogan of the shop says ‘Quaint and Quirky’ and it delivers. Each product is unique in it’s own way, reminiscent of our roots and entrenched in culture, but with a spin of quirk and modern art, and yet arraying sophistication and class.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="419" class="wp-image-1108" src="http://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3.jpg 750w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-300x168.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-450x251.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-225x126.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1109" src="http://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4.jpg" alt="" /></figure>



<p>As a one of a kind store, <strong>Kayal</strong> seeks to enable artisans and revive the practice of craftsmanship, therefore, bringing back a sense of community, a sense of belonging and integrating our roots in the modern world of consumerism. Today, while much of the market is dominated by large corporations, small businesses offer more diversity, economic growth in small geographic areas and personalized experience.</p>



<p>Moreover, the store empowers small business women who specialize in particular products like handmade soaps, pottery, and truck art inspired goods and helps them sculpt their own identity.</p>



<p>That being said, the prices at <strong>Kayal</strong> are certainly on the high-end and heavy on the average middle-class person’s pocket, but that’s because they’re handmade using high-quality raw material and a lot of hard work.</p>



<p>Unique in its nature, Kayal is also one of the first shops to go plastic free and promote environmental awareness. The incessant and reprehensible use of plastic has cost us our planet and stores like <strong>Kayal</strong> are really a breath of fresh air for environmental enthusiasts and a remarkable example of ethical retail.</p>



<p>While our country is blessed with skilled artists and great opportunity for growth, unfortunately, because of the staggering socio-economic situation, much of the talent remains untapped. Most companies prefer mass production as it is cost saving, convenient and automated and then there are stores like Kayal that believe in the value of human over machine, the importance of being unique and help create a space where craftsmanship can thrive.</p>

<p>Haveli Rai Bahadur Soojan singh- Wandering through the narrow streets of old city one could not ignore the amazing architecture of the pre-partition era – the magnificent buildings, beautiful wooden doors, the Chobaraas and Jharokhas. Just imagine life here some 100 years ago when these areas were best known for the people who lived here! Gurdwara, Temple and Mosque, all in one lane, now that&#8217;s what we call pluralism! But then, Partition wreaked havoc. What happened at the time of partition is a heart wrenching, sad history. Today the narrow streets of the city force us to revisit history. They tell us a sorry tale of being neglected and in ruins but still holding itself &#8211; strong.</p>



<p> It is a glaring fact the old heritage and architecture of the city are in complete shatters today. Among the overcrowded and narrow streets of Bhabra Bazaar area of Rawalpindi there lies a historic landmark. One of the most magnificent architectures of its time, <strong>Haveli Rai Bahadur Soojan Singh</strong>.</p>



<p> Haveli Soojan Singh was built by <strong>Rai Bahadur Soojan Singh</strong> in 1893 as a residence for his family. He was a distinguished personality of his era, a wealthy business man in Rawalpindi who had a flourishing timber business. He had a unique sense of architecture and design. But this house was not just another Haveli. It was a living museum in a class of its own. The Haveli was deliberately decorated with pictures of Rai Bahadur&#8217;s family, antiques, Victorian furniture and a milieu of silver and goldware decorated its walls. </p>



<p>The four storied building is divided into two parts, either side of the street and the roof connected through a bridge supported by iron mudguards/railings and decoratively covered with wood. </p>



<p>The wooden artwork on the roof, floors and windows is just marvelous. </p>



<p>The covered area of the haveli was 24,000 sq.ft (2,230 sq. meters) spread over four stories comprising of 45 rooms lit on evenings by huge lamps and chandeliers. </p>



<p>According to historians, the haveli glowed and sparkled like gold in the evenings when all these lamps and chandeliers were lit in all its massive rooms spread over such a huge area. </p>



<p>Historians also say that it was almost like a royal palace with a majestic throne made of gold and bedrooms furnished with ivory furniture. In the courtyards tiptoed peacocks and a tiger strolled through its corridors. Live music filled the haveli in the evenings. The haveli had its own water supply system with a waterwell connected to 30 lines.</p>



<p>Ms Shehla Shams, a student of Fatima Jinnah Women University, writes in her thesis on the Haveli: The Soojjan Singh Haveli was initially built as a residence for the Rai Bahadur&#8217;s family but then it was given to the Sikh generals to be used as a residential headquarters. It is a two-storied building with two viewing decks on the third and fourth floors that were probably built as lookout posts by Sikh soldiers in the 19th century.</p>



<p> Made from brick and timber, the Haveli reflects traditional building styles of the Sikhs of that era. The timber used was local and must have been easily procured since the Singh family had a flourishing timber business. The iron used in the pillars and embellishments of the doorways was imported from UK. </p>



<p>One thing that stands out about this building is that the staircase remains the same from the ground floor up to the fourth floor. The embellishments of the Haveli borrow a lot from Central Asian and European architectures. One finds intricately carved wooden false ceilings on the first floor. The pattern on the panels is clearly Central Asian and follows the same patterns as the Sethi Mohallas in Peshawar.</p>



<p>Over the years since the partition of the Indian Subcontinent it has housed refugees from Kashmir until General Ziaul-Haq had it vacated; handing it over to nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan to house a science college for girls but that project for some reasons did not see the light of the day.</p>



<p> Later the former Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed decided to turn it into a campus of the Fatima Jinnah Women&#8217;s University. However, this plan too could not materialize due to its present overcrowded location in a busy commercial area.&#8221; </p>



<p>Now, the government is mulling over an idea of starting a School of Cultures, Heritage, Architecture and Designs for girls. This project too may be shelved as there are no funds available for it. </p>



<p>The splendid haveli of Rai Bahadur Soojan Singh is in utter shambles these days due to lack of proper maintenance. One part of the haveli is completely damaged. Several parts of the roof have collapse and other parts are also fragmented. The majestic wood-work over the doors and windows are now being eaten away by termites and seepage through the walls has made the whole structure of the building weak raising fears that it could fall apart any day. </p>



<p>The grand rooms and halls which were once bright and echoed of gossips, music and laughter now lie vacant wearing a ghostly shroud. </p>



<p>The haveli requires extensive renovation efforts to restore it to its original glory. Today, in place of the dazzling structure stands a haunted bungalow. One can sense the grandeur of its beauty in spite of the skeleton that it is today as through the passage of time, it has been robbed and looted of its shimmering ornaments. </p>

<p>The place is rich with Hindu culture, history, and tradition. According to Hindu scripture, it was the deity, Krishna, who selected the grounds for temples and placed a hand-made shivling in it. However, the place is not only revered for the Hindus, but also for the Sikhs. The founder of Sikh faith, Guru Nanak, visited the temples during the early 1800s. Furthermore, the haveli of Hari Singh Nalwa, a highly praised General of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#8217;s army, lies adjacent to Ram&#8217;s temple. Strangely so, even Muslims have their connection to the site, since it was also the resting place for the famous Muslim Scholar, Al-Biruni, who used to spend time in the temples studying Hinduism.  </p>



<p> The Katas Raj Temples are situated along the M2 Motorway, near the town of Kallar Kahar. Surrounded by blue skies and dense vegetation, the temples are sign of reverence for Hindu mythology. Located at an altitude of 2000 feet, the whole complex covers a space of around 260 kanals. Historical records suggest that construction of the complex dates back to the 11th century, when it was built under a Kashmiri kingdom. </p>



<p>The location is home to Satgraha, an amalgamation of seven temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, five Kashmiri style medieval temples, and havelis spread around a pond area that holds great significance in the Hindu community. According to the Puranas (sacred Sanskrit scripture), the pond water comes from the deity Shiva&#8217;s tears, which he shed after the demise of his wife, Sati. It was commonly believed that the bright blue-green water of the pond could wash away ones sins. However, the once clear pond is now subject to eutrophication and excessive algal growth. The sanctuaries at Katas are, for the most part, built on square stages. The domes on the shrines stand tall and are a major part of the attraction, and the grand arched entrances to the temples indicate the architectural aesthetics that went into building this holy place. One of the most distinct structures is the Ramchandra Mandir, which is up to two stories high and consists of eight rooms. However, the entire site of Katas seems to crumble before your eyes, as you walk across this historic landmark. Paint chipped off, cracked domes and bird&#8217;s nests everywhere; lack of maintenance has changed what this place used to look like. As a place of worship, it seems slightly odd that none of the idols have been preserved and kept in the temples, though understandably this could be due to dangers of vandalism and theft.</p>

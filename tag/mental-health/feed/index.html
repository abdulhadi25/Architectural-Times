										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mental health indicates the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being of a person. It is all about how people feel and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to signify or imply the absence of mental disorders. Living with mental illness is one of the hardest things to do. It is a regular problem without any solution to it. There are treatments like medication and psychotherapy that are incredibly advantageous. Some of the most common self-help recommendations are to exercise, meditate, and be more present, these things seem to work for so many people. However, other proven methods to help fight mental health issues aren’t mentioned as often.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health issues</strong> can affect our daily lives, relationships, and physical health gravely. The most common mental health problems are anger issues, anxiety, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, depression, BPD, OCD, etc. To find the right coping mechanism you need to be patient as it takes time and effort, but it can highly impact how you feel. If you were unable to find successful techniques to help you fight mental illness by yourself, or maybe you want to add a few more to your list, here are a few coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals.</p>
<h2><strong>Accept Your Condition And Find Solution:</strong></h2>
<p>The first stage of curing any mental disorder is to accept the fact that your mental state is not sound or healthy, like any other disease. You cannot change the fact that you have a mental illness, so instead of trying to get rid of it or pretend that it doesn’t exist you need to accept that you have a problem and you need to find a solution to it. Ignoring these problems will only drain your energy. Accept yourself. Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to help yourself take care of it. Either you can go to a doctor or psychotherapist or you can help yourself by doing some exercise.</p>
<p>There are different types of methods for managing mental health problems. Treatment is highly individual, some strategies or treatments are more successful as compared to others. A person who has a chronic mental disorder may choose different treatments at different stages in their life. The individual needs to work meticulously with a doctor who can help them identify their problem and then provide them with suitable treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Early signs of Mental health issues:</strong></h2>
<p>There are so many visible signs of mental illness that anyone can notice as there is no physical test or scan that reliably indicates whether a person has developed a mental illness or not. We should look out for the following signs:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family</li>
<li>avoiding activities that you would normally enjoy</li>
<li>sleeping too much or too little</li>
<li>eating too much or too little</li>
<li>feeling hopeless</li>
<li>consistently low energy</li>
<li>using mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine, more frequently</li>
<li>displaying negative emotions</li>
<li>being confused</li>
<li>being unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or cooking a meal</li>
<li>having persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly</li>
<li>thinking of causing physical harm to themselves or those around them</li>
</ol>
<p>sometimes hearing voices and experiencing delusions</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Treatments:</strong></h2>
<p>There are various types of treatments that can help with mental illness, few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the type of treatment that takes a psychological approach to treat mental illness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy are some of the examples of psychotherapy. Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists are some of the doctors that carry out this type of treatment.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help people fathom the base of their mental illness and start to work on more wholesome thought patterns that help support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation, self-harm, and depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medication</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people who deal with strong mental health issues take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs. Although these medications cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve mental health and symptoms in general and help a person resume his/her social interaction and a normal routine while they work on the improvement of their mental health.</p>
<p>These medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of happy chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Some of these drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation from the brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-help</li>
</ul>
<p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to help themselves and make changes to their lifestyle to improve their condition. These changes might include reducing alcohol intake, improving their sleep cycle, and eating a balanced, healthy diet. Self-help also includes taking out time from work to resolve personal issues that may be causing great damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>People with conditions such as anxiety or depression may benefit from relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness. Having a support system of friends and family can also help a lot in improving one&#8217;s mental state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything around us is changing. Our lives have been altered in ways we don’t even understand yet, it’s okay to feel scared.</p>
<p>While many are quick to adjust to this new normal, it’s important to understand not everyone is able to adapt so quickly. It’s okay to take your time. It’s okay to feel lost.</p>
<p>As humans, we all have our own ways of dealing with things. It’s okay to be different.</p>
<p>If it seems like everyone around you is handling the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/what-to-do-with-your-wanderlust-in-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarantine</a> better than you. It’s okay to breakdown.</p>
<p>At a time where the world has stopped but life goes on it’s okay to not be productive. It’s okay to do nothing.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel like nothing is in your control, and it’s okay to want to give up.</p>
<p>If you lay awake at night paralyzed with the fear of the unknown. It’s okay to worry.</p>
<p>When your legs are tired and your shoulders burdened with the weight of the world. It’s okay to rest.</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms over us like a sword hanging from a thread, it’s okay to feel terrified.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contain your emotions and feel them spilling out everywhere, it’s okay to be sensitive.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have been trying to control your feelings, I want to tell you it’s okay to surrender.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel scared, it’s okay to feel lonely, it’s okay to feel helpless, it’s okay to feel angry, it’s okay to feel frustrated, it’s okay to feel sad, it’s okay to lose hope, it’s okay to cry!</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to process what is happening in this world. But it’s extremely important to understand that it’s okay to feel!!</p>
<p>Whatever it is that is brewing inside you, it’s okay to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Many of us have no idea where to go from here and that’s okay.</p>
<p>The beauty in this whole situation is that we are all in this together and together we will be okay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article you will find 5 <strong>myths about counseling</strong> which are listed below</p>
<h3>1- There must be something very wrong with me before I go for therapy</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1692" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001.jpg" alt="Myths about Counseling" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001.jpg 626w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-370x246.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-185x123.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-400x266.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image001-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>People often think that very serious mental health issues have to take place before seeking therapy. There is a misconception regarding when is a good time to seek help. The reality is that you don’t need to be struggling with a disorder like anxiety or depression. People seek grief therapy because the loss of a loved one becomes too unbearable, others come for counseling because they feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities. The point is that you don’t need to have a mental health disorder or illness, counseling simple provides a space for you to express your concerns freely and openly.</p>
<h3>2- I should go to a psychiatrist first because they are doctors</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-1693" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png" alt="5 Myths about Counseling" width="701" height="351" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png 553w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-300x150.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-370x185.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-185x93.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-20x10.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-400x200.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-96x48.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>The stigma around therapy is so strong in our society that it is much more socially acceptable to go to a medical doctor rather than counselors or therapists. But the truth is that psychiatrist are the last person you should go to, because their job is to diagnose and prescribe not to give you coping mechanisms or provide support. If you feel you are struggling mentally then it is best to start with going to a therapist, often times they will guide you to a psychiatrist if they feel like you could benefit from one.</p>
<h3>3- Counseling will “fix” me or “cure” me</h3>
<p>The job of a therapist is not to fix or cure anyone and this is very important to understand. People often think that there will be some kind of resolution through therapy or that all their problems will be fixed and they will become “normal”. This is not true at all, therapy is about providing a person with a safe enough environment where one can openly explore all aspects of themselves and find answers from within.</p>
<h3>4- Talking about my problems isn’t going to help me</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1695" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1695" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006.jpg" alt="myths and facts about counseling" width="731" height="505" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006.jpg 553w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-300x207.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-370x256.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-185x128.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-20x14.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-400x276.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image006-69x48.jpg 69w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1695" class="wp-caption-text">Myths about Counseling</figcaption></figure>
<p>More often than not all people need is someone to listen to them, to be heard, without judgment and without any advice or suggestions. Sometimes we don’t want to visit old wounds, we fear that talking about our problems will only bring up repressed material and we will feel worse. This may be true if you don’t stick with therapy, its important to understand that yes initially things might get worse before they get better but the whole point of therapy is to help you get to a place where you are able to look within yourself and embrace all parts of you, good and bad.</p>
<h3>5- A therapist is like a life coach</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1696" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg" alt="A therapist is like a life coach" width="612" height="393" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg 612w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-300x193.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-370x238.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-185x119.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-400x257.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-75x48.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>This could not be further from the truth and yet it is the biggest misconception I come across in my practice. We are not life coaches, our job description does not include telling you how to live your life or help you make daily decisions, or even life changing decisions. We believe that the client is the expert of their life, they know what’s best for them, they have the ability to choose and decide for themselves. All we must do is provide them with enough empathy, acceptance and understanding in order to nourish their autonomy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s heartwarming to see the awareness being raised around the topic of <strong>mental health</strong>. While our efforts are not going to waste there is still so much left to do to really eliminate the stigma associated with mental health and help-seeking behavior.  </p>



<p>Most articles I’ve come across in recent times focus on highlighting the importance of mental health. The articles will share some statistics or will explain what is mental health and how we should be paying more attention to it. None of the writers talk about what it&#8217;s like dealing with some suffering from a mental illness or dealing with mental illness themselves. None of the articles focus on educating the reader about the resources available, or what can be done to eradicate the stigma. It&#8217;s like we have been made aware of the problem but we are not given a solution.</p>



<p>I recognize that it is important to share information about mental health in order to create awareness. I believe it is equally important to talk about how we as a society can work together to help those struggling with mental illnesses. It is also important to talk about how families, friends and peer groups can help a person recover and sustain a healthy lifestyle. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists all are great resources to access if you are brave enough to put yourself out there, but typically people are not comfortable seeking help because families are disapproving, society is judgmental and friends are unsupportive.</p>



<p>So what can we do as a society to help these individuals feel comfortable in their own skin? Well, the answer is simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>We can <em>listen </em>to them without judgment and try to understand what’s going on in their head. Don’t offer them advice or solutions, it only makes them feel inadequate as if they don’t know what’s best for them.</li>
<li><em>Support</em> them by not undermining their feelings instead of validating them.</li>
<li>Accept their reality. Even if we don’t agree with what they are feeling or we don’t understand what they are going through is irrelevant, people struggling with mental health disorders just want someone to be there for them.</li>
<li> Practice empathy and not sympathy. Here’s how I see it when you sympathize with someone you are just saying the words, “that sucks” “I’m sorry” “poor you” etc. it requires little emotional support on our part, it’s a quick attempt to make the person feel better without really taking an interest in what’s bothering them. Empathy requires us to be emotionally involved in a person’s problem by making their problem our problem and working together towards a solution. So an easy way to remember the difference between sympathy and empathy is the first letter of the word S and E saying and engaging.</li>
<li>Be <em>kind. </em>Talking to someone who is struggling can be difficult but it’s important to remember that a few kind words can mean the world to someone dealing with a mental illness. Your patience will help heal then, and your kindness can ease their anxiety. It doesn’t take much to be kind.   </li>
</ul>

<p>Move over Wilshire Grand: A planned 77-story skyscraper wants
to be the tallest building in Los Angeles and west of the Mississippi. That&#8217;s
no accident. </p>



<p>Unlike the Wilshire Grand which was, purportedly, not
intentionally planned to&nbsp;beyond this tallest tower in the city or&nbsp;beyond
this skyscraper was definitely&nbsp;intended to a record-holder, says Jeff&nbsp;DiMarzio,
whose firm DiMarzio Kato&nbsp;Architects is designing the project at&nbsp;Figueroa
and Third in Bunker Hill.&nbsp;“Who doesn&#8217;t want bragging rights?”&nbsp;says
DiMarzio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 1,107 feet, the building would rise&nbsp;just a bit
higher than the 1,100-foot-tall&nbsp;Wilshire Grand. Unlike the Wilshire&nbsp;Grand,
the building at 333 South&nbsp;Figueroa would not use a spire to help&nbsp;it
reach superlative heights.&nbsp;The project calls for converting the 13- story
hotel building on the site into 224&nbsp;market-rate apartments.&nbsp;Planning
documents first spotted by&nbsp;Urbanize LA indicate that the existing&nbsp;two-story
podium and event space&nbsp;would be demolished and replaces with&nbsp;the
skyscraper, which would hold 599&nbsp;hotel rooms, 242 condos, nearly 37,000&nbsp;square
feet of amenities, and almost&nbsp;29,000 square feet of commercial&nbsp;space.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The redeveloped property would&nbsp;contain condos,
apartments, hotel&nbsp;rooms, and event space.&nbsp;“The [new] building had to
be&nbsp;compatible with the existing property”&nbsp;and the elements already on
the site.&nbsp;Considering the needs of the property,&nbsp;architects
essentially “broke the&nbsp;building into geometric halves and&nbsp;tapered it
up to the skyline,” DiMarzio&nbsp;says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The architect says the gradually&nbsp;narrowing
building is sort of like the&nbsp;“sliver towers” that are cropping up in&nbsp;New
York, but on a slightly shorter scale.&nbsp;“The building is simple [and]
elegant”&nbsp;with a composition of low-e glass&nbsp;(which reduces the amount
of ultraviolet&nbsp;light that passes through it) and steel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main body of the high-rise is hotel&nbsp;spacea “mini
convention hotel” with&nbsp;plenty of ballroom space, says&nbsp;DiMarzio. Above
the hotel are condos,&nbsp;which gradually increase in size as the&nbsp;floors
rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topmost floors of the building would&nbsp;hold two
single-floor penthouses, one&nbsp;two-story penthouse, and a rooftop&nbsp;lounge
and bar that&#8217;s expected to be&nbsp;open to the public, says DiMarzio.&nbsp;The
project&#8217;s developer, Shenzhen New&nbsp;World Group, has owned the hotel&nbsp;since
2010, when it bought the property&nbsp;for roughly $60 million.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The redeveloped property will be&nbsp;across the
street from a site which&nbsp;Jamison Services plans to turn into a&nbsp;41-story
residential tower.&nbsp;</p>

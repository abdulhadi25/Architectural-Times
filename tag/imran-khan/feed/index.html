<p>71 years ago, on the 14<sup>th</sup> of August was born a nation cradled in melancholic optimism. One million people sacrificed their lives for the 30 million who would then give rise to a country which would forever change the dynamics of the world as we know it today. Near and dear ones were lost, displacement flashed through and through and lives were dedicated to bring this ideological genesis to its settlement. Mohammad Ali Jinnah had a vision for Pakistan, but little did he know, this country was already destined for diplopia. Since then, Pakistan has been governed by 19 prime ministers, most of whom have distorted history to suit their agenda, twisted policies for their own benefit and exploited resources to feed their desires. For most of the citizens today, survival is an everyday struggle and any new leader will have to authenticate their sincerity to the country in this morass entanglement of corruption and deceit.</p>

<p>The current situation of Imran Khan’s governance is an apt representation of this wrestle between loyalty and practicality. Whether Imran Khan will able to sway the trust of Pakistani citizens, only time will tell.</p>



<p>But, what if Jinnah was alive today? Would Imran Khan have governed differently? Would his policies have reflected the ideology of Jinnah? What would Jinnah had advised him to do?</p>

<p>A fictional letter from Jinnah to <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/tag/imran-khan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imran khan</a> guiding him to better leadership, with quotes from Jinnah;</p>



<p>“Imran Khan,</p>



<p>Congratulations on becoming our Prime Minister. You have embarked on a great crusade and your task will not be an easy one. There will be trying moments. Your critics will rage. Do not lose sight of the responsibility you have taken up. Give life to the dream that I had once envisioned for Pakistan.</p>



<p>“With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve. Think 100 times before you take a decision, but once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man. Failure is word unknown to me.”</p>



<p>I wish to bring four important points to your attention.</p>



<p>Firstly, I hope for Pakistan to be a country with immense religious tolerance and tremendous respect for minorities. Provide them with security, equality, freedom and free access to practice their faith. I do not want to see non Muslims suffer because of their faith and stripping them of their fundamental rights would be a devastating tragedy. Abolish discriminatory policies and condemn their persecution and oppression. Every citizen of Pakistan is important and every life should be safeguarded.</p>



<p>Secondly, the economic situation of Pakistan seems to be in shambles. I can understand why you’re struggling. Formulate economic plans that provide the citizens with relief from poverty and anguish. There is no use for political independence if a country does not have economic independence. “No nation and no people can ever do anything very much without making themselves economically powerful in commerce, trade and industry. Make policies that support and encourage local businesses. Take initiatives to ensure economic reconstruction of the country. Take steps to have a fair legislation for factory safety, limited working hours for women and children, clearance of slums, widened powers of labor unions, sickness and disability insurance and health planning of towns. Our labor is the backbone of our country and equitable distribution of wealth is fundamental. Empower the working class.</p>



<p>This brings me to my third point; military. The army is the most essential body of service in Pakistan and carries a very heavy burden.</p>



<p>“Do not forget that the armed forces are the servants of the people. You do not make national policy; it is we, the civilians, who decide these issues and it is your duty to carry out these tasks with which your entrusted”.</p>



<p>The ambitions of the military should mirror the determination of the civilians. The army should be a well organized modern structure and a culture of discipline.</p>



<p>Lastly, I wish to talk about Kashmir. As the leader of a Muslim country, always stand up to injustice. Humanity will always take precedence over nationalism. Do not despair and give up on your Muslim brothers and sisters and do not abandon them to fight the enemy alone.</p>



<p>“Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan”. Fight for their independence.</p>



<p>The people of Pakistan are impassioned, spirited and wilful. They have always come out strong in times of hardship and always will. Lead them with dignity and respect. Honor their devotion towards their country.</p>



<p>My prayers are with you.</p>



<p>Jinnah.”</p>

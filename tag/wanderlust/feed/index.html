<p>In case you are not a bookworm, we have another adequate way to calm down your obsession with traveling. As we are living in the digital world, we can get the benefit of it in this hard time. The digital world provides us a vast range of sources to quench our wanderlust. Amongst, access to factual films, tourism-based documentaries, and factual sites about tourism are worthy to mention. This way you can even visualize the places and make prints in your mind.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the national tourism organization of Scotland has produced a short documentary of memories of tourists’ visits to Scotland. Featuring stunning visuals from Skara Brae in Orkney to Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway, from Airlie Monument in Angus to Dunnottar Castle in Aberdeen shire and many others, it is an emblem of hope.</p>
<h3><strong>Pen down about past adventures of traveling</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1772" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1.jpg" alt="Pen down about past adventures of traveling" width="627" height="298" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1.jpg 627w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-370x176.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-185x88.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-20x10.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-400x190.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image010-1-101x48.jpg 101w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p>Another interesting thing you can do to entertain your craving is to write about your past adventures. All tourists must have an extensive record of untold stories from their travels and exploration of peculiar places.  Penning down your past adventures and reviving your memories would be as exciting as embarking on a new journey. This stimulating and exciting act will surely satisfy your wanderlust without leaving home. You can also add a twist in it by sharing it with your friends through social media. It’s going to be a great experience of roaming different places without even leaving your home. The physical journey is forbidden but we are not restricted to embark on a journey into the retreats of our minds and revive some of our exciting hunts and share them with the world.</p>

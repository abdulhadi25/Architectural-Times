										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article you will find 5 <strong>myths about counseling</strong> which are listed below</p>
<h3>1- There must be something very wrong with me before I go for therapy</h3>

<p>People often think that very serious mental health issues have to take place before seeking therapy. There is a misconception regarding when is a good time to seek help. The reality is that you don’t need to be struggling with a disorder like anxiety or depression. People seek grief therapy because the loss of a loved one becomes too unbearable, others come for counseling because they feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities. The point is that you don’t need to have a mental health disorder or illness, counseling simple provides a space for you to express your concerns freely and openly.</p>
<h3>2- I should go to a psychiatrist first because they are doctors</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-1693" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png" alt="5 Myths about Counseling" width="701" height="351" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004.png 553w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-300x150.png 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-370x185.png 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-185x93.png 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-20x10.png 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-400x200.png 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image004-96x48.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>The stigma around therapy is so strong in our society that it is much more socially acceptable to go to a medical doctor rather than counselors or therapists. But the truth is that psychiatrist are the last person you should go to, because their job is to diagnose and prescribe not to give you coping mechanisms or provide support. If you feel you are struggling mentally then it is best to start with going to a therapist, often times they will guide you to a psychiatrist if they feel like you could benefit from one.</p>
<h3>3- Counseling will “fix” me or “cure” me</h3>
<p>The job of a therapist is not to fix or cure anyone and this is very important to understand. People often think that there will be some kind of resolution through therapy or that all their problems will be fixed and they will become “normal”. This is not true at all, therapy is about providing a person with a safe enough environment where one can openly explore all aspects of themselves and find answers from within.</p>
<h3>4- Talking about my problems isn’t going to help me</h3>

<p>More often than not all people need is someone to listen to them, to be heard, without judgment and without any advice or suggestions. Sometimes we don’t want to visit old wounds, we fear that talking about our problems will only bring up repressed material and we will feel worse. This may be true if you don’t stick with therapy, its important to understand that yes initially things might get worse before they get better but the whole point of therapy is to help you get to a place where you are able to look within yourself and embrace all parts of you, good and bad.</p>
<h3>5- A therapist is like a life coach</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1696" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg" alt="A therapist is like a life coach" width="612" height="393" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007.jpg 612w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-300x193.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-370x238.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-20x13.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-185x119.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-400x257.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image007-75x48.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>This could not be further from the truth and yet it is the biggest misconception I come across in my practice. We are not life coaches, our job description does not include telling you how to live your life or help you make daily decisions, or even life changing decisions. We believe that the client is the expert of their life, they know what’s best for them, they have the ability to choose and decide for themselves. All we must do is provide them with enough empathy, acceptance and understanding in order to nourish their autonomy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mental health indicates the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being of a person. It is all about how people feel and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to signify or imply the absence of mental disorders. Living with mental illness is one of the hardest things to do. It is a regular problem without any solution to it. There are treatments like medication and psychotherapy that are incredibly advantageous. Some of the most common self-help recommendations are to exercise, meditate, and be more present, these things seem to work for so many people. However, other proven methods to help fight mental health issues aren’t mentioned as often.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health issues</strong> can affect our daily lives, relationships, and physical health gravely. The most common mental health problems are anger issues, anxiety, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, depression, BPD, OCD, etc. To find the right coping mechanism you need to be patient as it takes time and effort, but it can highly impact how you feel. If you were unable to find successful techniques to help you fight mental illness by yourself, or maybe you want to add a few more to your list, here are a few coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals.</p>
<h2><strong>Accept Your Condition And Find Solution:</strong></h2>
<p>The first stage of curing any mental disorder is to accept the fact that your mental state is not sound or healthy, like any other disease. You cannot change the fact that you have a mental illness, so instead of trying to get rid of it or pretend that it doesn’t exist you need to accept that you have a problem and you need to find a solution to it. Ignoring these problems will only drain your energy. Accept yourself. Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to help yourself take care of it. Either you can go to a doctor or psychotherapist or you can help yourself by doing some exercise.</p>
<p>There are different types of methods for managing mental health problems. Treatment is highly individual, some strategies or treatments are more successful as compared to others. A person who has a chronic mental disorder may choose different treatments at different stages in their life. The individual needs to work meticulously with a doctor who can help them identify their problem and then provide them with suitable treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Early signs of Mental health issues:</strong></h2>
<p>There are so many visible signs of mental illness that anyone can notice as there is no physical test or scan that reliably indicates whether a person has developed a mental illness or not. We should look out for the following signs:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family</li>
<li>avoiding activities that you would normally enjoy</li>
<li>sleeping too much or too little</li>
<li>eating too much or too little</li>
<li>feeling hopeless</li>
<li>consistently low energy</li>
<li>using mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine, more frequently</li>
<li>displaying negative emotions</li>
<li>being confused</li>
<li>being unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or cooking a meal</li>
<li>having persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly</li>
<li>thinking of causing physical harm to themselves or those around them</li>
</ol>
<p>sometimes hearing voices and experiencing delusions</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Treatments:</strong></h2>
<p>There are various types of treatments that can help with mental illness, few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the type of treatment that takes a psychological approach to treat mental illness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy are some of the examples of psychotherapy. Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists are some of the doctors that carry out this type of treatment.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help people fathom the base of their mental illness and start to work on more wholesome thought patterns that help support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation, self-harm, and depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medication</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people who deal with strong mental health issues take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs. Although these medications cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve mental health and symptoms in general and help a person resume his/her social interaction and a normal routine while they work on the improvement of their mental health.</p>
<p>These medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of happy chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Some of these drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation from the brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-help</li>
</ul>
<p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to help themselves and make changes to their lifestyle to improve their condition. These changes might include reducing alcohol intake, improving their sleep cycle, and eating a balanced, healthy diet. Self-help also includes taking out time from work to resolve personal issues that may be causing great damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>People with conditions such as anxiety or depression may benefit from relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness. Having a support system of friends and family can also help a lot in improving one&#8217;s mental state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many definitions of empathy but the one that comes up the most is “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes”. Sounds simple, right? But what exactly does this statement mean? How can we practice this? Putting myself in someone else’s shoes means that I must understand their perspective, it means I must be able to look at the world through their eyes not my own. Again, this sounds simple but empathy is actually a lot harder than we think.</p>
<p>Previously it was believed that empathy is something we are born with, it is something that is innate, it comes naturally to us, we don’t have to try hard to be empathic, we just are. But if we really think about what empathy is we can conclude that empathy is in fact a skill, it is something that we can learn. Anyone can become empathic through acceptance, no judgment and vulnerability.</p>
<p>Lets breakdown each of these qualities for better understanding. Empathy requires us to not only look at or understand but to actually <em>believe</em> the other persons perspective, this means that whatever they are thinking or feeling must be taken as a reality, as their truth, regardless of how ridiculous or outrageous it sounds. Empathy requires us to put our own biases aside and to truly absorb the pain and emotions as if they were our own, to accept that whatever the other person is experiencing is real for them, therefore real for us too.</p>

<p>Empathy means staying out of judgment. Easier said than done! It is extremely difficult to avoid judgment because it is something we have been so engrained to do. We are judged from the day we are born till the day we die and we are encouraged to judge others as well. But judgments stand in the way of being empathic, its important to acknowledge these judgments, to understand where they come from and how they effect our human interactions. We can do this by first understanding what stereotypes we have, what prejudices we have, what preconceived notions do we carry? This part is a bit difficult as it requires us to really look within ourselves and understand the negative side of ourselves. Despite the discomfort of introspection, it is important to challenge all our thoughts and belief. This will help us not only understand ourselves better, and therefore develop empathy towards ourselves, it will help us in accepting others the way they are.</p>
<p>This means empathy is a choice and it’s a very vulnerable choice. Not only does it require us to be open and accepting of ourselves but it also requires us to access deep within ourselves an unconditional positive regard for others.</p>

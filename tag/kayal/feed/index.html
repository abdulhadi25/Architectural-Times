<p><strong>Kayal</strong>, a hidden secret of Islamabad, is a retail store situated in the busy and bustling Beverley Center. Skirted amongst the hippest restaurants and cafes and overlooking the green and serene Margalla hills, it stands as the pinnacle of art and charm.</p>
<h2 style="color: #4e4e4e;">Kayal where quirky meets culture.</h2>



<p><strong>Kayal</strong> strives to bring together artists and small businesses from all over Pakistan and provide them with a platform to showcase their handcrafted goods. The store’s aim is to offer locally made products that are trendy, high in quality and a celebration of our rich cultural heritage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="676" class="wp-image-1107" src="http://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2.jpg 750w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-300x270.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-450x406.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-225x203.jpg 225w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-20x18.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Kayal</strong> exhibits products from more than twenty different businesses offering a diverse variety that ranges from home décor, skincare, jewelry, apparel, and stationary. <strong>Kayal</strong> has also launched its own line of clothing that includes summery kurtas, floral dresses and chic lowers. One can spot ceramic art, hand-poured candles, bahawalpuri style jhumkay, hand painted coasters and trays and much more. Pakistan inspired products like cushions, tables, paintings and scarves also seem to dominate the trend of the shop. The slogan of the shop says ‘Quaint and Quirky’ and it delivers. Each product is unique in it’s own way, reminiscent of our roots and entrenched in culture, but with a spin of quirk and modern art, and yet arraying sophistication and class.</p>

<p>As a one of a kind store, <strong>Kayal</strong> seeks to enable artisans and revive the practice of craftsmanship, therefore, bringing back a sense of community, a sense of belonging and integrating our roots in the modern world of consumerism. Today, while much of the market is dominated by large corporations, small businesses offer more diversity, economic growth in small geographic areas and personalized experience.</p>



<p>Moreover, the store empowers small business women who specialize in particular products like handmade soaps, pottery, and truck art inspired goods and helps them sculpt their own identity.</p>



<p>That being said, the prices at <strong>Kayal</strong> are certainly on the high-end and heavy on the average middle-class person’s pocket, but that’s because they’re handmade using high-quality raw material and a lot of hard work.</p>



<p>Unique in its nature, Kayal is also one of the first shops to go plastic free and promote environmental awareness. The incessant and reprehensible use of plastic has cost us our planet and stores like <strong>Kayal</strong> are really a breath of fresh air for environmental enthusiasts and a remarkable example of ethical retail.</p>



<p>While our country is blessed with skilled artists and great opportunity for growth, unfortunately, because of the staggering socio-economic situation, much of the talent remains untapped. Most companies prefer mass production as it is cost saving, convenient and automated and then there are stores like Kayal that believe in the value of human over machine, the importance of being unique and help create a space where craftsmanship can thrive.</p>

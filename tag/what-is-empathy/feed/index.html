										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many definitions of empathy but the one that comes up the most is “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes”. Sounds simple, right? But what exactly does this statement mean? How can we practice this? Putting myself in someone else’s shoes means that I must understand their perspective, it means I must be able to look at the world through their eyes not my own. Again, this sounds simple but empathy is actually a lot harder than we think.</p>
<p>Previously it was believed that empathy is something we are born with, it is something that is innate, it comes naturally to us, we don’t have to try hard to be empathic, we just are. But if we really think about what empathy is we can conclude that empathy is in fact a skill, it is something that we can learn. Anyone can become empathic through acceptance, no judgment and vulnerability.</p>
<p>Lets breakdown each of these qualities for better understanding. Empathy requires us to not only look at or understand but to actually <em>believe</em> the other persons perspective, this means that whatever they are thinking or feeling must be taken as a reality, as their truth, regardless of how ridiculous or outrageous it sounds. Empathy requires us to put our own biases aside and to truly absorb the pain and emotions as if they were our own, to accept that whatever the other person is experiencing is real for them, therefore real for us too.</p>

<p>Empathy means staying out of judgment. Easier said than done! It is extremely difficult to avoid judgment because it is something we have been so engrained to do. We are judged from the day we are born till the day we die and we are encouraged to judge others as well. But judgments stand in the way of being empathic, its important to acknowledge these judgments, to understand where they come from and how they effect our human interactions. We can do this by first understanding what stereotypes we have, what prejudices we have, what preconceived notions do we carry? This part is a bit difficult as it requires us to really look within ourselves and understand the negative side of ourselves. Despite the discomfort of introspection, it is important to challenge all our thoughts and belief. This will help us not only understand ourselves better, and therefore develop empathy towards ourselves, it will help us in accepting others the way they are.</p>
<p>This means empathy is a choice and it’s a very vulnerable choice. Not only does it require us to be open and accepting of ourselves but it also requires us to access deep within ourselves an unconditional positive regard for others.</p>

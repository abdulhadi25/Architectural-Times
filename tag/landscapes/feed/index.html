<p>Swat is today known as ‘Mini Switzerland of Pakistan’, after the boom in the tourism industry. It has a lot of scenics and natural landscapes to offer to those who decide to witness them in person. The lush green valley provides a retreat space in its mountains, snowcapped peaks, and crystal clear lakes. The hospitable nature of the residents, combined with the picturesque landscapes makes it a top travel destination, for not only Pakistanis but also foreigners touring the Northern Areas of Pakistan. What most people miss during their travels is that Swat has much more to offer than just scenic views, cool climate, and peace. The city has hundreds of years of heritage, as it was home to the Gandhara Civilization. Multiple carvings, Stupas, and Buddha statues are spread around the city, making it an attraction for Buddhists as well.</p>

<p>When we walk the trails in Swat, with clear streams on one side, followed by blossoming peach trees and scenic Mountain View on the other side, we must remember the people who have walked the same path before us, the civilizations who had once lived here. As you are walking up the trail towards the Amluk Dara Stupa, you can witness it in all its glory. The mountains in the distance serve as the perfect backdrop for this historic site. The tall stupa appears to be the perfect element to complete the scenic view. Walking around the Stupa, touching the stone from hundreds of years earlier instantly connects you to the past. You can visualize the life that was once present here and wonders what an average day in their life was like. Navigating through the ruins brings a sensation of being a part of a scene that is much older than you.</p>

<p>As you steer through the streets of Mingora, you find yourself surrounded by market places that seem to be placed very randomly and built wherever land was found, but that perspective soon changes when you look in the distance and find houses propped up on the mountains with high stairways leading up to them. You now look at it as a piece of art. It is all framed perfectly when you stand atop a mountain and look down at the city, and see their tall stairways, busy streets, and small houses. It all seems to blend in together, complimenting each other’s existence.</p>

<p>One cannot really say that they have visited Swat if they haven’t interacted with the rich culture and history it has to offer. The landscapes when seen in reference to the city’s architecture and archaeological site sets the tone and gives you a hint of where this city came from.</p>



<p> In order to truly appreciate the present, it is necessary to build a connection with the past. The people of Swat have realized this and made continuous efforts to ensure that the city presents itself in all its glory- past and present, to the visitors. In the age of travel blogging and tourism, generally, being on a rise, we should build long-lasting connections with places that we visit. Observing the present scenery against the manifestations of the past does just that for the tourist so that when they return to their homes, they truly feel connected to the city of Swat, a city that is now more than just landscapes to you.</p>

<p>Move over Wilshire Grand: A planned 77-story skyscraper wants
to be the tallest building in Los Angeles and west of the Mississippi. That&#8217;s
no accident. </p>



<p>Unlike the Wilshire Grand which was, purportedly, not
intentionally planned to&nbsp;beyond this tallest tower in the city or&nbsp;beyond
this skyscraper was definitely&nbsp;intended to a record-holder, says Jeff&nbsp;DiMarzio,
whose firm DiMarzio Kato&nbsp;Architects is designing the project at&nbsp;Figueroa
and Third in Bunker Hill.&nbsp;“Who doesn&#8217;t want bragging rights?”&nbsp;says
DiMarzio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 1,107 feet, the building would rise&nbsp;just a bit
higher than the 1,100-foot-tall&nbsp;Wilshire Grand. Unlike the Wilshire&nbsp;Grand,
the building at 333 South&nbsp;Figueroa would not use a spire to help&nbsp;it
reach superlative heights.&nbsp;The project calls for converting the 13- story
hotel building on the site into 224&nbsp;market-rate apartments.&nbsp;Planning
documents first spotted by&nbsp;Urbanize LA indicate that the existing&nbsp;two-story
podium and event space&nbsp;would be demolished and replaces with&nbsp;the
skyscraper, which would hold 599&nbsp;hotel rooms, 242 condos, nearly 37,000&nbsp;square
feet of amenities, and almost&nbsp;29,000 square feet of commercial&nbsp;space.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The redeveloped property would&nbsp;contain condos,
apartments, hotel&nbsp;rooms, and event space.&nbsp;“The [new] building had to
be&nbsp;compatible with the existing property”&nbsp;and the elements already on
the site.&nbsp;Considering the needs of the property,&nbsp;architects
essentially “broke the&nbsp;building into geometric halves and&nbsp;tapered it
up to the skyline,” DiMarzio&nbsp;says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The architect says the gradually&nbsp;narrowing
building is sort of like the&nbsp;“sliver towers” that are cropping up in&nbsp;New
York, but on a slightly shorter scale.&nbsp;“The building is simple [and]
elegant”&nbsp;with a composition of low-e glass&nbsp;(which reduces the amount
of ultraviolet&nbsp;light that passes through it) and steel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main body of the high-rise is hotel&nbsp;spacea “mini
convention hotel” with&nbsp;plenty of ballroom space, says&nbsp;DiMarzio. Above
the hotel are condos,&nbsp;which gradually increase in size as the&nbsp;floors
rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topmost floors of the building would&nbsp;hold two
single-floor penthouses, one&nbsp;two-story penthouse, and a rooftop&nbsp;lounge
and bar that&#8217;s expected to be&nbsp;open to the public, says DiMarzio.&nbsp;The
project&#8217;s developer, Shenzhen New&nbsp;World Group, has owned the hotel&nbsp;since
2010, when it bought the property&nbsp;for roughly $60 million.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The redeveloped property will be&nbsp;across the
street from a site which&nbsp;Jamison Services plans to turn into a&nbsp;41-story
residential tower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dubai is synonymous with the cities of the rich as the glamorous
city is home to the highest number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in the
region. </p>



<p>According to New World Wealth, there&nbsp;are approximately over 55,000 HNWIs&nbsp;with $1 million-plus assets, 2,590 multimillionaires with $10-million assets and&nbsp;10 billionaires who have made the&nbsp;emirate as their home. But where do&nbsp;most of these millionaires live in the&nbsp;emirate? </p>



<p>An analysis by the US-based Webster&nbsp;Pacific showed that
the Jumeirah, Umm&nbsp;Suqeim and surrounding areas have&nbsp;the highest
concentration of HNWIs,&nbsp;followed by the Al Karama, Al Raffa and&nbsp;Al
Barsha areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the highest number of rich&nbsp;people lives in Al
Karama, Al Safa,&nbsp;Deira, Trade Centre area, Dubai Marina&nbsp;and Palm
Jumeirah and surrounding&nbsp;areas as these parts of the emirate&nbsp;have
population ratios as compared to&nbsp;other emirates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Dubai has favorable income and&nbsp;wealth tax laws and a plethora of luxury housing, making it an attractive&nbsp;location,&#8221; said Steve Bazant, a consultant&nbsp;at Webster Pacific.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;There are extensive shops and&nbsp;services
across the country for wealthy&nbsp;visitors and no shortage of beautiful&nbsp;beaches.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The emirate&#8217;s total population is just&nbsp;over three million and 55,000 are&nbsp;millionaires, making up 1.8 percent of&nbsp;the total population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The emirate&#8217;s total population is just&nbsp;over three million and 55,000 are&nbsp;millionaires, making up 1.8 percent of&nbsp;the total population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the rich people like to live on&nbsp;beachfront
properties which offer not&nbsp;just highly luxurious apartments and&nbsp;houses
but also are in close proximity&nbsp;to the major shopping malls in the&nbsp;emirate.
</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the wealthiest suburbs in&nbsp;Dubai are located close to the beach&nbsp;and offer great views and a host of&nbsp;nearby activities. Also, the apartments&nbsp;and houses in these areas offer top-end luxury and many of them are located close&nbsp;to top-end shopping centers such as the&nbsp;Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates,&#8221;&nbsp;said Andrew Amoils, head of research at&nbsp;New World Wealth.&nbsp; According to New World Wealth&#8217;s recently released report, Emirates Hills, Jumeirah&nbsp;Golf Estate, Dubai Marina and Palm&nbsp;Jumeirah are the affluent parts of Dubai.&nbsp;More than 38,000 millionaires have moved&nbsp;to the UAE over the last 20 years, the report&nbsp;recently said.&nbsp; </p>

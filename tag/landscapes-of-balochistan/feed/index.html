With all its grandeur,  the place has a historical significance as it is associative to the shrine of a local saint whose name was Kharwari Baba. Howbeit, the tag “Ziarat” literally means “Shrine.” The place is occupied with a number of the comfy rest houses banquet throughout the area. The eminence of these rest houses is that they are carpeted with lavish green turfs that are dotted with cherry trees producing mouthwatering and juicy fruit which are free to pick and eat. The land possesses the second biggest Juniper forest in the world. Significantly it is considered to be more than 5,000 years old. These add to the scenery by varying the landscape and look exquisite in the winters when they are topped by snow.</p>

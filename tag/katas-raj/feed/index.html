<p>The place is rich with Hindu culture, history, and tradition. According to Hindu scripture, it was the deity, Krishna, who selected the grounds for temples and placed a hand-made shivling in it. However, the place is not only revered for the Hindus, but also for the Sikhs. The founder of Sikh faith, Guru Nanak, visited the temples during the early 1800s. Furthermore, the haveli of Hari Singh Nalwa, a highly praised General of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#8217;s army, lies adjacent to Ram&#8217;s temple. Strangely so, even Muslims have their connection to the site, since it was also the resting place for the famous Muslim Scholar, Al-Biruni, who used to spend time in the temples studying Hinduism.  </p>



<p> The Katas Raj Temples are situated along the M2 Motorway, near the town of Kallar Kahar. Surrounded by blue skies and dense vegetation, the temples are sign of reverence for Hindu mythology. Located at an altitude of 2000 feet, the whole complex covers a space of around 260 kanals. Historical records suggest that construction of the complex dates back to the 11th century, when it was built under a Kashmiri kingdom. </p>



<p>The location is home to Satgraha, an amalgamation of seven temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, five Kashmiri style medieval temples, and havelis spread around a pond area that holds great significance in the Hindu community. According to the Puranas (sacred Sanskrit scripture), the pond water comes from the deity Shiva&#8217;s tears, which he shed after the demise of his wife, Sati. It was commonly believed that the bright blue-green water of the pond could wash away ones sins. However, the once clear pond is now subject to eutrophication and excessive algal growth. The sanctuaries at Katas are, for the most part, built on square stages. The domes on the shrines stand tall and are a major part of the attraction, and the grand arched entrances to the temples indicate the architectural aesthetics that went into building this holy place. One of the most distinct structures is the Ramchandra Mandir, which is up to two stories high and consists of eight rooms. However, the entire site of Katas seems to crumble before your eyes, as you walk across this historic landmark. Paint chipped off, cracked domes and bird&#8217;s nests everywhere; lack of maintenance has changed what this place used to look like. As a place of worship, it seems slightly odd that none of the idols have been preserved and kept in the temples, though understandably this could be due to dangers of vandalism and theft.</p>

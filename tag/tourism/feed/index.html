										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ranikot fort &#8211; A hidden architectural Gem of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tourism has been given a lot of importance in the past two decades by developing states all around the globe. One of the countries that were least expected to be a desirable tourist location was Pakistan, due to its non-secure image in the global world. However, the country has worked hard to improve its image and had been ranked as the number 1 travel destination by the United States-based luxury and Lifestyle publication. Pakistan covers different landscapes and has various weathers that one may experience during the travel through the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has gained most of its popularity due to the northern regions of Gilgit Baltistan and KPK province. As these are the famous areas of Pakistan which the locals know about and the international tourism community is aware of. However, many other places carry historical importance and are very significant in terms of architecture. The region/land known as Pakistan has seen a lot of different leaders of the regions who were of different ethnicity before the freedom. So, the <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/5-best-places-to-visit-in-pakistan/">architectural sites of Pakistan</a> can be a point of attraction for tourists and the people of interest.</p>
<h2><strong>The Great Wall of Sindh:</strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg" alt="Ranikot Fort - The wall of sindh" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh.jpg 1024w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-300x169.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-768x432.jpg 768w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-370x208.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-800x450.jpg 800w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-20x11.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-185x104.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-740x416.jpg 740w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-400x225.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ranikot-Fort-The-Wall-of-Sindh-85x48.jpg 85w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h2>
<p>Most of the population of the world is aware of the Great Wall of China due to its features and history but there are very few who know about the Great Wall of Sindh in Pakistan. The Great Wall of Sindh is the outer boundary of a fort which is known as Ranikot Fort. The length of the fort is more than 31 Km’s and it was declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. One may be amazed to know that Ranikot fort holds the title for the largest fort in the world as well. The fort ramparts are usually compared to that of the Great Wall of China.</p>
<p><strong>Ranikot Fort</strong> is about 90 Km&#8217;s from the city of Hyderabad and about 2 hours of drive from the city Karachi. It lies in Jamshoro district Pakistan and it is situated in the second largest national park of Pakistan (Kirthar National Park). The fort is a marvel for the people who have an interest in history and architecture. One side of the fort is covered by rocky hills and the other three sides are covered by tall walls, the walls of the fort are interspersed with bastions and we can the towers on three different spots are semicircular. The most interesting factor of this fort is that this fort has another small fort at the heart which is called the Miri Fort. It is about 3 Km&#8217;s inside from the main gate. The small fort is said to be the residence of the Mir Royal Family.</p>
<p>The structure of the entire fort is made with stone and lime mortar. The walls of the fort are not in a straight line, rather they are built-in zig zag with 4 gates for entry into the fort. Two gates were built parallel to each other, they are built in such a manner that the Sann River crosses diagonally both the gates. The river s along with the skirt of the gates making it difficult to be breached. The other two gates have multi-leveled doors that have floral ornamentation and carved stones on the walls. The main gate is well preserved and can be climbed to get a great view on both sides of the fort. The fort is said to be constructed in 1812 for 1.2 Million Rupees at that time in history. It is a very huge project that was completed at that time. It was the last capital of the Amirs of Sindh. The initial base of the fort had been laid down by Sindh Archeologists but there were renovations made in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century by the Talpur Mirs.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Visit Ranikot Fort:</strong></h2>
<p>The fort carried great importance in the history of the region and is the largest for the world, one should visit to see that how structures were constructed over such a huge land area back in the times. The carving of the stone has been recognized by different organizations among the best carvings of the world from historical times. The location of the fort is something that makes it more attractive as there is barren land on one side of the fort and we see an entire river flowing on the other side.</p>
<p>The architecture of the structure is unique and special in its way, with multi-layered doors, the semi-circular towers, and a fort within a fort. The reason for its construction is still unknown but it must have been home to a huge population and the architects who constructed this fort must have been very skilled.</p>

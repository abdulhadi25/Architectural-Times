<p>This monumental work of Pakistan is being sponsored by the Bahria Town, one of Pakistan’s largest real estate developers, that is, property mogul Malik Riaz’s venture.

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1757" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008.jpg" alt=" Minutiae of the Grand Jamia Mosque " width="624" height="362" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008.jpg 624w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-300x174.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-370x215.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-20x12.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-185x107.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-400x232.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image008-83x48.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>The world’s third-largest Mosque has exclusive minutiae as the architecture of the mosque is mingling of Mughal, Persian, Chinese and Turkish architecture. Howbeit, the architecture of the mosque is of great significance since it’s the hodgepodge of distinct architectural blueprints. This exclusive fusion amplifies the grandeur of the mosque and nominates it as a crowning achievement. The Grand Jamia Mosque covers an area of 50 acres at the top of a 60 ft (18 m) high. The site of the mosque is fundamentally worthy of making it palpable from miles away. Likewise, the design of the mosque is an absolute chef-d&#8217;oeuvre in the domain of architecture that includes a 325 ft (99 m) long minaret. Additionally, it has 150 feet high steel structured dome; the tallest Dome in Pakistan. The interior of the mosque is also worth-appreciated as the Kofi Calligraphy is used for the décor of the mosques, embellished with Sindhi styled woodwork and Glass art.</p>

<p>The iconic building of the mosque has a magnificent look due to the fusion of the world’s great architectural styles. Also, having an amalgamation of Mughal and European architectural styles, the mosque has a spell-binding look and design. The rudiments of the grand Jamia mosque include an international state of the art air-conditioning university, along with an Islamic cultural center, <a href="https://architecturaltimes.news/museum-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">museum</a>, and a research center.

<h3><strong>Majesty of the Grand Jamia Mosque, Karachi </strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1759 size-full" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012.jpg" alt="World’s Third Largest Masjid" width="623" height="302" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012.jpg 623w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-300x145.jpg 300w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-370x179.jpg 370w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-185x90.jpg 185w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-20x10.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-400x194.jpg 400w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image012-99x48.jpg 99w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>The majesty of the Grand Jamia Mosque is evident from its structure, design, site, area, and fusion of the world’s tremendous architecture styles. It is believed that the mosque is majestically going to be the world’s Third <strong>Largest Mosque</strong>, surrounded by hefty gardens which are fenced by arch-shaped walls on all four sides. Subsequent to the Masjid-al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah and Masjid-e-Nabvi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina; the two biggest Mosques in the world, the grand Jamia Mosque is going to be the third-largest mosque in the world paving a way of victory. However, there is no ambiguity in the fact that there can be no Mosque more divine than the former two mosques respecting their sacredness. But the splendor of the fact is that the Grand Jamia Mosque Karachi is pompously subsequent to the world’s most sacred and sanctified places. Thence, it is a great honor and privilege for the architecture of our country.</p>

<p>Dubai is synonymous with the cities of the rich as the glamorous
city is home to the highest number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in the
region. </p>



<p>According to New World Wealth, there&nbsp;are approximately over 55,000 HNWIs&nbsp;with $1 million-plus assets, 2,590 multimillionaires with $10-million assets and&nbsp;10 billionaires who have made the&nbsp;emirate as their home. But where do&nbsp;most of these millionaires live in the&nbsp;emirate? </p>



<p>An analysis by the US-based Webster&nbsp;Pacific showed that
the Jumeirah, Umm&nbsp;Suqeim and surrounding areas have&nbsp;the highest
concentration of HNWIs,&nbsp;followed by the Al Karama, Al Raffa and&nbsp;Al
Barsha areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the highest number of rich&nbsp;people lives in Al
Karama, Al Safa,&nbsp;Deira, Trade Centre area, Dubai Marina&nbsp;and Palm
Jumeirah and surrounding&nbsp;areas as these parts of the emirate&nbsp;have
population ratios as compared to&nbsp;other emirates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Dubai has favorable income and&nbsp;wealth tax laws and a plethora of luxury housing, making it an attractive&nbsp;location,&#8221; said Steve Bazant, a consultant&nbsp;at Webster Pacific.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;There are extensive shops and&nbsp;services
across the country for wealthy&nbsp;visitors and no shortage of beautiful&nbsp;beaches.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The emirate&#8217;s total population is just&nbsp;over three million and 55,000 are&nbsp;millionaires, making up 1.8 percent of&nbsp;the total population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the rich people like to live on&nbsp;beachfront
properties which offer not&nbsp;just highly luxurious apartments and&nbsp;houses
but also are in close proximity&nbsp;to the major shopping malls in the&nbsp;emirate.
</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the wealthiest suburbs in&nbsp;Dubai are located close to the beach&nbsp;and offer great views and a host of&nbsp;nearby activities. Also, the apartments&nbsp;and houses in these areas offer top-end luxury and many of them are located close&nbsp;to top-end shopping centers such as the&nbsp;Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates,&#8221;&nbsp;said Andrew Amoils, head of research at&nbsp;New World Wealth.&nbsp; According to New World Wealth&#8217;s recently released report, Emirates Hills, Jumeirah&nbsp;Golf Estate, Dubai Marina and Palm&nbsp;Jumeirah are the affluent parts of Dubai.&nbsp;More than 38,000 millionaires have moved&nbsp;to the UAE over the last 20 years, the report&nbsp;recently said.&nbsp; </p>

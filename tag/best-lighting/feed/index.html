We have come a long way since the days of when Thomas Edison invented the first light bulb to today when we have the most Avant-Garde and aesthetically pleasing designs in lighting that seem more like works of art than simply a functional tool. <br /><br />You could literally use lights as a centerpiece to enhance the beauty of your room without having to invest much on furniture. It can affect the mood of any room making it either futuristic, romantic, study-centric, majestic or glamorous. So lets look at some of <strong>the top lighting trends of 2020.  </strong></p>



<p>Luckily, today we have a plethora of lighting designs to choose from, from Retro to Vintage to LED, Crystal, Copper and minimalistic.</p>

The iron rods give an industrial feel which is in perfect alignment with the modern idea of minimalistic interiors.</p>



<h2>2. Tiffany Lights </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1240" src="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights.jpg" alt="panos lighting Architectural Times Magazine" width="600" height="603" srcset="https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights.jpg 600w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-150x150.jpg 150w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-180x180.jpg 180w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-90x90.jpg 90w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-450x452.jpg 450w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-270x270.jpg 270w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-20x20.jpg 20w, https://architecturaltimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tiffany-Lights-225x226.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Bohemian and organic, each one of the Tiffany Chandeliers is handcrafted with meticulousness with its breathtaking stained glass mosaic style.</p>



<p>Each lamp is a collectible item with high durability and colors that never fade. If the colors look a little dull due to exposure to pollution, a little bit of oil on a soft cloth will bring back the chandelier’s vivacity. It would look great with antique or classical furniture as well as modern both.</p>



<h2><strong>3. </strong>LED Lights</h2>
